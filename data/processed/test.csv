r7xbw1,0,optimize gradient descent for small known problem hello i hope i m posting in the correct community because my problem isn t part of machine learning but i figured you d be the best help when it comes to gradient descent a part of a hobby project of mine is photometric stereo take images under different lighting conditions to calculate the shape of an object so i need to minimize a cost function depending on 64 measured values with variables to optimize being a direction vector and a scalar value being the albedo luminance of the object but hundreds of millions of times within a reasonable time i didn t find any fitting papers addressing what i need exactly typical photometric stereo with the added fresnel equation for s polarized light and robustness to shadows so i developed my own algorithm this works reasonably well but all optimizations i found have been more or less trying different stuff and seeing what works i have already added momentum to the direction vector part and can directly solve the luminance in one iteration hyperparameter optimization is also on the list so to my question how do i properly optimize a gradient descent algorithm that solves a small known problem and should converge with as little steps as possible or at least learn how to do it so i d also appreciate any links to research papers lecture slides

riqxrq,0,do large language models understand us blog post by blaise aguera y arcas summary large language models llms represent a major advance in artificial intelligence ai and in particular toward the goal of human like artificial general intelligence agi it’s sometimes claimed though that machine learning is “just statistics” hence that progress in ai is illusory with regard to this grander ambition here i take the contrary view that llms have a great deal to teach us about the nature of language understanding intelligence sociality and personhood specifically statistics do amount to understanding in any falsifiable sense furthermore much of what we consider intelligence is inherently dialogic hence social it requires a theory of mind since the interior state of another being can only be understood through interaction no objective answer is possible to the question of when an “it” becomes a “who” — but for many people neural nets running on computers are likely to cross this threshold in the very near future

rmrifl,0,multi output generation with sparsely fixed output i am trying to use generative deep learning to synthetically generate certain biological parameters given some experimental constraints i am using gans to do this and i have been successful so far for the next step i want to fix certain parameters in the output vector to some experimentally verified values and then generate the rest of the parameters in the output vector based on this the features in the output vector of the gans are obviously coupled by some complex non linearities so changing or fixing one of them will propagate to the other outputs as well is there some way to do this what i have already tried researched 1 transfer learning on a trained generator with a curated training dataset where the output features i want to fix are already constrained it works the gan learns to fix the values of certain output features but this is because they are already fixed in the training data 2 context encoding in gans i am aware that context encoding and similar tasks have been already showcased where gans are used to fill in missing regions in an image based on the rest of the image but extrapolating this to my case is hard to make a direct comparison my case is analogous to having an image that has only a few pixels that are shown and the rest of the image is masked and need to be inferred i could not find any literature on such sparsely fixed output if anyone is aware of some literature or blog that tackles a similar problem please let me know

rju3nf,1,how to detect timing anomalies using ml methods hello everyone i am really new to machine learning algorithms right now there is a research project on my desk and being expected addressed with some ml methods we would like to detect the timing anomalies in the power traces of our embedded system let s say i can sample the system voltage at some rate for 1 second exactly after the moment when the system powers on to make the scenario as simple as possible for an easy start the system embedded power on behaviors are fixed so we expect the voltage patterns should be the same for each run as well if the noises are not considered what i have done is to collect 30 traces 20 items for training while 10 for validation as the training set hoping the trained model can give me a prediction at each timestamp during the testing phase so that a threshold can be set to alert if the incoming values deviate too far from the prediction it is an anomaly the collected 30 traces would not be exactly the same considering the random noises and the different micro architectural states the main reference i am using is this tutorial i select the cnn algorithm and perform the training and retrieve the prediction waveform as shown below x200b blue is the reference trace without timing anomalies while red is the prediction trace it looks like the cnn captures some patterns but the amplitude seems to appear a proportional difference the below are the squared errors between the two traces the maximum error is around 25 x200b square errors between the reference trace and the prediction one however if i compare the prediction trace with a corrupted trace with many timing anomalies the square errors report the deviations at more timestamps but the maximum value is smaller than 25 so i cannot set a static threshold for claiming those anomalies x200b blue is the corrupted trace with timing anomalies while red is the prediction trace x200b square errors between the corrupted trace and the prediction one with that i do have a few quick questions which might look naive to you experts 1 is cnn the correct option to go with for this purpose otherwise what kind of algorithm i should use for this project in your opinion 2 does the prediction trace make sense why does the amplitude difference occur between the predictions and reference 3 is it possible to set a dynamic threshold to differentiate the timing anomalies in the latter scenario 4 i am using pytorch any suggestions you can offer to run the training procedure faster the training took me more than 1 day i really appreciate you finishing reading such a long question really looking forward to hearing from you about any suggestions and opinions thank you

r8v4fq,0,project dall 3 generate better images with fewer tokens through clip guided diffusion link to images and code link to diffusion model colab this is a project i created that combines transformer image generation with clip guided diffusion it s named after the 3 projects it s based on dalle pytorch clip guided diffusion and vqgan btw a big thanks to lucidrains rivershavewings openai and the vqgan team for their work if in general ddpm gan vae why do transformer image generators all use vqvae to decode images wouldn t it be better to use a diffusion model i was wondering about this and started experimenting with different ways to decode vector quantized embeddings with a diffusion model see discussion here after a lot of trial and error i got something that works pretty well the resulting diffusion model basically absorbs one scaling factor so you can get similar image quality with 16x16 tokens diffusion compared to 32x32 tokens vqgan i then trained a relatively small dalle pytorch model with these embeddings and put the whole thing together in the github colab above in terms of generalization ability eg avocado armchairs there s no substitute for a large scale transformer but for common object categories people food etc the small transformer diffusion works surprisingly well so this is kind of a proof of concept the conditional diffusion approach should provide a flat boost in quality to any transformer model including cogview ru dalle vq diffusion and openai s original dall e the parameters for this architecture is mostly dictated by the pretrained models i m leveraging there are a lot of potential optimizations that i haven t explored for training from scratch such as removing the final unet downsampling layer but i ll leave it to someone with a gpu cluster

r70stj,0,how a feature store be useful for my scenario i recently came across feature stores as a mechanism to operationalize ml pipelines in a commercial setting it sounds good but i m finding it hard to understand when and where to use it when doing exploratory data analysis for example consider a simple use case of prediction house prices for a given geographical location i source the raw data from a remote server that contains historical house prices with some columns features as below latitude longitude total rooms house size total bedrooms year of construction this is just a small representation of the feature set as a data engineer one has to probably look into the raw data do some simple statistical analysis like 1 identify null or nan values and impute them 2 identify the co relation of the features with respect to the target variable and determine if some features be dropped or not 3 identify the unique count for a numeric variable and determine to remove that feature or column if the unique count is below a certain threshold 4 delete duplicate rows 5 perform onehotencoding for categorical data 6 identify and remove outliers 7 perform dimensional reduction feature scaling now assuming that i would be performing just the first few steps or i would be performing all the above steps i would like to know how employing a feature store would speed up or rather operationalize my ml pipelines

r8v6rk,1,career change into programming data at 30 y o – options in europe hi everyone before starting just a little bit of background about myself i am 30 years old french and therefore a citizen of the eu i already have a master s degree in engineering in chemistry materials polymer i have been working for 6 years as a process engineer in the automotive industry 2 years in france 2 years in slovakia 2 years in germany i have ended my job in germany but i am currently learning part time german in a school there to pass b2 i have a lot of free time 6 7 hours day i also speak english if necessary i can consider passing my c1 certificate and french so now after many months of reflexion i would like to change my career the field in which i can work mainly related to my studies does not suit me i have a great attraction for programming and computer science and even if i only have a very basic knowledge about it i would like to change into this field i m not totally sure yet but i would like to do and am therefore targeting one of the following jobs data analyst or data scientist and or probably later on a job related to machine learning ai i m just discovering it but i am getting super excited about it for info i have been learning python data science by myself for a couple of months now so finally here are my questions what are the best learning options for me to be employable or to have certified or company recognised knowledge in order to find a job in data science data analyst for example to start and which ones would you recommend i am looking to study in europe online if possible or in person in germany to find a job in germany switzerland austria for example it can be fast or long free or not i have some time and money to invest now but i don t want to if i realise it is not necessary different options i found so far self learning a couple of portfolio projects free but difficult to prove competences no certifications and no supervision bootcamps online expensive but quite fast and intense however i m not sure if this is recognized by companies and if it will really help me find a job master degree do you think i have a chance to find a master online in europe starting 2022 knowing that i don’t have any educational background in cs master conversion course i have heard about it maybe it is only in uk i am not totally sure about how it works but knowing that i have already a master degree i probably don’t have to start from the beginning bachelor or should i start first with a bachelor is a bachelor enough online would be better any city or country in europe or are there other schools which are not bootcamps not universities but something between that are recognized or certified and might help me a lot if you have any ideas or information that could help me i would be very grateful i am motivated and i can invest a lot in this project but i am not totally sure what would be the best option at the moment or what qualification is really necessary for this job thanks in advance

r15mte,1,has anyone used algorithmia to deploy models i m unconvinced algorithmia advertises themselves as an mlops platform for data scientists and they provide an easy way to host models on a scalable rest api this sounds like a perfect solution for a data scientist or hobbyist who wants to host models for cheap and not worry about the devops but as i ve gotten more familiar with it i have more questions for the base tier algorithmia requires you to host your model s request handling code on a github repository owned by them a separate repository for your request handling code seems like a strange pattern to develop in they also encourage you to develop in their web ui again another pattern that feels forced they also have an ominous section in their terms of service that says you do not transfer ownership of the software to algorithmia but you do hereby grant algorithmia a fully paid up and royalty free license to use and permit others to use the software which feels overly aggressive for forcing you to use their source hosting between an unnatural development environment and a sketchy ownership clause i m reluctant to continue using algorithmia has anyone had similar experiences with algorithmia am i just being overly skittish and misinterpreting the ownership clause are their better repository patterns git subtrees that other people have used with them are there better companies to host models or should i have never even attempted leaving the aws and gcp hosting land

qw0rxa,0,organizing ml reproducibility – the reproducibility scale hey r ml a lot has been said ranted about reproducibility in ml it always seems like everyone agrees that reproducibility is important but still many projects are difficult or impossible to reproduce part of the reason is that reproducibility is hard to quantify and different people define it very differently i wrote a blog trying to provide a concrete scale for reproducibility with a practical rating system and a checklist that can help project creators maintainers validate the reproducibility of their work the scale consists of 5 criteria a 5 star system 1 code 2 configuration 3 data artifacts 4 environment 5 evaluation with specific requirements for each one i tried to order them in a growing level of complexity so that a 3 star project is lower effort but less reproducible than a 5 star project i also add a format for a reproducibility md file that can be filled out and added to projects to help the community assess the reproducibility of a project they want to use check it out here 👉 i know this might be controversial so i d honestly love to have an open discussion – do you think i m missing something should the order be different would also love to get a pr to the format of reproducibility md you can do that here

qz3qtv,0,5 considerations for deploying machine learning models in production – what did i miss i wrote a post about considerations for deploying machine learning models in production below are the considerations what did i not consider i know the first consideration seems obvious but i thought it was worth mentioning 1 use your laptop for development as a best practice consider your development environment first most data scientists or ml engineers invariably use their laptops for development testing or debugging code because of simplicity easy to access and install the latest ml libraries practitioners overwhelmingly prefer laptops over clusters for development we are spoiled by ides and syntax highlighted editors for good reason python developers like to customize their environments to match their staging environment with library dependencies using conda or python virtual environments ideally as a best practice if the same code developed on their laptop can run with minimal changes on a staging or production environment on the cluster it immensely improves the end to end developer productivity consider your laptop as a preferred choice of development environment with the possibility of extending or syncing your code to the cluster environment in the cloud consideration number 1 use your laptop for development as a best practice 2 training at scale and tracking model experiments unlike the traditional software development cycle the model development cycle paradigm is different a number of factors influence an ml model’s success in production first the outcome of a model is measured by its metrics such as an acceptable accuracy second achieving an accuracy that satisfies the business goal means experimentation with not only one model or ml library but many models and many ml libraries while tracking each experiment runs metrics parameters artifacts etc as vital as accuracy is so is a developer’s choice of ml libraries to experiment with third accuracy is directly linked to the quality of acquired data bad data results in a bad model data preparation feature extractions feature selection standardized normalized features and data imputations encoding are all imperative steps before the cleansed data lands into a feature store accessible to your model training and testing phase or inference in deployment fourth a choice of programming language that is not only familiar to your data team — data analysts data scientists and ml engineers — but also supported by many ml libraries employed during model experimentation and training phases python seems to be the de facto choice alongside a choice of a programming language is the choice of an ml framework for taming compute intensive ml workloads deep learning distributed training hyperparameter optimization hpo and inference — all at horizontal scale — from your laptop single node multiple cores to multiple nodes with multiple cores and finally the ability to easily deploy models in diverse environments at scale part of web applications inside mobile devices as a web service in the cloud etc consideration number 2 consider using model life cycle development and management platforms like mlflow dvc valohai weights biases or sagemaker studio and ray ray tune ray train formerly ray sgd pytorch and tensorflow for distributed compute intensive and deep learning ml workloads 3 managing machine learning features feature stores are emerging pivotal components in the modern machine learning development cycle as more data scientists and engineers work together to successfully put models in production having a singular store to persist cleaned and featurized data is becoming an increasing necessity as part of the model development cycle feature stores address operational challenges they provide a consistent set of data between training and inference they avoid any data skew or inadvertent data leakage they offer both customized capability of writing feature transformations both on batch and streaming data during the feature extraction process while training and they allow request augmentation with historical data at inference which is common in large fraud and anomaly detection deployed models or recommendation systems aside from challenges and considerations of putting models in production operationalizing ml data is equally important model accuracy depends on good data and feature stores help manage precomputed and cleansed features for your model training and production inference during model serving consideration number 3 consider feature stores as part of your model development process look to feast tecton sagemaker hopsworks and databricks for feature stores 4 deploying serving and inferencing models at scale once the model is trained and tested with confidence that it met the business requirements for model accuracy seven crucial requirements for scalable model serving frameworks to consider are framework agnostic a model serving elected framework should be ml framework agnostic that is it can deploy any common model built with common ml frameworks for example pytorch tensorflow xgboost or scikit learn each with its own algorithms and model architectures business logic model prediction often requires preprocessing post processing or ability to augment request data by connecting to a feature store or any other data store for validation model serving should allow this as part of its inference model replication some models are compute intensive or network bound as such the elected framework can fan out requests over to model replicas load balancing among replicas to support parallel request handling during peak traffic request batching not all models in production are employed for real time serving often models are scored in large batches of requests for example for deep learning models parallelizing these image requests to multiple cores taking advantage of hardware accelerators to expedite batch scoring and utilize hardware resources is worthy of consideration high concurrency and low latency models in production require real time inference with low latency while handling bursts of heavy traffic of requests the consideration is crucial for best user experience to receive millisecond responses on prediction requests model deployment cli and apis a ml engineer responsible for deploying a model should be able to use model server’s deployment apis or command line interfaces cli simply to deploy model artifacts into production this allows model deployment from within an existing ci cd pipeline or workflow patterns of models in production as ml applications are increasingly becoming pervasive in all sectors of industry models trained for these ml applications are complex and composite they range from computer vision to natural language processing to recommendation systems and reinforcement learning that is models don’t exist in isolation nor do they predict results singularly instead they operate jointly and often in four model patterns pipeline ensemble business logic and online learning each pattern has its purpose and merit machine learning engineers adopt two common approaches deploy these patterns of models in production one is to embed models into a web server and the other is to offload to an external service each approach has its own pros and cons with respect to the seven considerations above consideration number 4 look to seldon kfserving or ray serve for all these seven requirements 5 observing and monitoring model in production model monitoring often an overlooked stage as part of model development lifecycle is critical to model’s viability in the post deployment production stage it is often an afterthought at an ml engineer’s peril models have an afterlife of viability that viable life in production needs a constant watchful or sentinel eye in fact monitoring as a phase is simply a continuation of the model serving why consider model monitoring for a number of practical reasons this stage is pivotal let’s briefly discuss them data drifts over time as we mentioned above our quality and accuracy of the model depends on the quality of the data data is complex and never static meaning what the original model was trained with the extracted features may not be as important over time some new features may emerge that need to be taken into account for example seasonal data changes such features drifts in data require retraining and redeploying the model because the distribution of the variables is no longer relevant model concept changes over time many practitioners refer to this as model decay or model staleness when the patterns of trained models no longer hold with the drifting data the model is no longer valid because the relationships of its input features may not necessarily produce the model’s expected prediction hence its accuracy degrades models fail over time models fail for inexplicable reasons a system failure or bad network connection an overloaded system a bad input or corrupted request detecting these failures’ root causes early or its frequency mitigates user bad experience or deters mistrust in the service if the user receives wrong or bogus outcomes systems degrade over load constantly being vigilant of the health of your dedicated model servers or services deployed is just as important as monitoring the health of your data pipelines that transform data or your entire data infrastructure’s key components data stores web servers routers cluster nodes’ system health etc collectively these aforementioned monitoring model concepts are called model observability this step is now an acceptable imperative in mlops best practices monitoring the health of your data and models should never be an afterthought rather it ought to be part and parcel of your model development cycle consideration number 5 for model observability look to evidently ai arize ai arthur ai fiddler ai or whylabs ai thanks to this excellent pytorch reddit post for inspiring the formatting of this post

r8bbsb,1,requesting help for my situation hello i am an undergraduate researcher in my senior year of my computer science and engineering degree the research is focused mainly on computer vision i am currently working with pose estimation image segmentation and object tracking i have been working on this research for about 3 months i have had enough machine learning background to complete my tasks so far but the last 3 months have made me realize i have some gaps in my knowledge about 2 years ago i completed a deep learning course on udacity using pytorch it went through all of the basics for machine learning including a lot of the essential mathematics however i didn t apply what i learned for awhile after the course was over and i m a bit rusty on some of the details additionally i took an autonomous vehicles course at my university which included some basic introductions to computer vision i have also learned a lot over the past 3 months basically i m comfortable doing things like utilizing existing models to solve a specific problem and tuning models hyperparameters structure to boost performance however the mathematics and theory behind what i m doing is fuzzy in my memory and i would really like to rebuild my understanding from the ground up next semester i will be required to do some more advanced work using computer vision techniques to either fine tune an existing animal behavioral analysis network or finish building one that has already been started that will most likely benefit from some additional learning on my part and i would like to use my winter break a little over 3 weeks to do it my question is how can i best utilize this time i know 3 weeks isn t a ton of time but i want to be as efficient as possible with the time i have i know the coursera stanford machine learning course is highly recommended however i am concerned it is too broad introductory for my case as it covers a decent amount of topics i am already comfortable with on the other hand there is a good chunk of information in that course that will be great to fill in the gaps in my knowledge would it be better to do a more advanced course that focuses on computer vision specifically even though some of my fundamentals are missing rusty thanks

ro1ebu,0,redditors who work at big tech does 0 1 improvement matter to your company i have seen from time to time that when a paper is on the borderline of acceptance because of marginal improvement 0 1 0 2 accuracy of some sort the authors can always argue that a marginal but consistent improvement can be a large sum of revenue for companies that make billions of dollars ml in industry is not so simple although it is just a new method redeploying a whole pipeline can be very time consuming i want to ask people who are working at big tech does that improvement really matter are your companies willing to redeploy this improvement
r5ktec,0,which one do you prefer you had an idea you already implemented and tested it in pytorch now you want to test it on architecture a which is publicly available but in tensorflow would you 1 implement your idea on a s framework or 2 implement a on your framework would you change your answer if you want to further test your idea on a few more architectures
r8jea7,1,what specific ml technique should i use for predicting a country s religion through the attributes of its flag colors stripes crosses etc it s my 2nd year in the computer science field and machine learning already broke my brain just trying to learn it don t get me wrong the concept of machine learning is so cool and that s why i gambled myself into learning it and making something out of bit we are required to create any system that can predict something out of a dataset my idea was to have a dataset of countries with its flag and its attributes still trying find it somewhere online or i ll create it myself and predict the country s religion either nationally recognized or practice by the largest population however i can t seem to think of a technique that would help this project i m thinking of neural networks but it might be a bit difficult technique to start but i won t mind doing it as long as it is the best option that s why i m here asking the humble but powerful redditors to guide me peace
r6h3h8,0,i created an auto updating kaggle dataset that collects high frequency crypto market data updates daily 20 related trading notebooks i am happy to announce that i finally finished cleaning organizing creating baselines and developing an automated collection pipeline that collects minute by minute market data for cryptocurrencies it updates on kaggle every day and will keep doing so until the competition is over maybe even more the whole project took me a lot of time to develop and is not easy to maintain so please if you find this of value your feedback support is highly appreciated the competition as some of you know there is crypto forecasting competition is running on kaggle g research crypto forecasting in this competition we need to use machine learning for forecasting short term returns of popular cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin ether dogecoin we are provided a dataset of millions of rows of high frequency market data dating back to 2018 which we should use to build our models on once the submission deadline has passed the final score will be calculated over the following 3 months using live crypto data as it is collected auto updating kaggle dataset to make things more interesting i created an auto updating kaggle dataset that collects high frequency market data for multiple cryptocurrencies updates daily on kaggle available for anyone to play with also i also released 20 starter notebooks each demonstrating a different model or method for forecasting future returns this project was meant to be for the currently running crypto forecasting competition by g research however since it is publicly available i assumed many others would like to also have a look mimics real life better than typical datasets this is a unique opportunity to work in a much more real life setup than usual kaggle because the datasets update daily so if you mess up and overfit you see it tomorrow 😂 anyway this is an ongoing project that is also beginner friendly since it is highly documented many more time series finance related notebooks will be released in the future so this can also serve as a first stop when studying time series analysis baselines starter notebooks cv model hyperparam optimization time series models feature engineering neural network starter ae analysis 1 lightgbm starter analysis 2 catboost starter written from scratch series agg xgboost starter supervised ae janestreet 1st ae janestreet 1st engineering transformer volatility features reinforcement learning ppo starter about the validation grouptimeseriessplit ⏳ in the making fork them as you please enjoy yourself auto updating full price datasets i created an up to today auto updating dataset which contains the full historical data for all assets of the competition so you can easily build models that utilize it the datasets are split to each asset since they are much heavier than the competition data the datasets have also been labeled as described in the competition overview and had been organized in a way that they are at the exact format of the competition data the goal of this is to provide a dataset that 1 contains the full history for each asset currently the competition data goes back to 2018 this dataset contains data from even earlier 2 auto updating daily due to the high volatility of the cryptocurrency market we should train our models on the most recent data available these datasets have a backend pipeline for collecting formatting and reuploading to kaggle they are scheduled to be updated daily every single day until the end of the competition 3 preprocessed the datasets had been ffilled to overcome any missing values issue that is present in the original competition dataset the datasets binance coin bitcoin cash bitcoin cardano dogecoin eos io ethereum ethereum classic iota litecoin monero maker stellar tron bonus dataset i ve also uploaded a dataset containing the most powerful source for predicting cryptocurrencies movement elon musk s twitter 😂 it is simply an updated dataset of all elon musk s tweets 😂 i must check if elon musk can help us win 👌 you can play with it yourself here technical details about the data for every asset in the competition the following fields from binance s official api endpoint for historical candlestick data are collected saved and processed 1 timestamp a timestamp for the minute covered by the row 2 asset id an id code for the cryptoasset 3 count the number of trades that took place this minute 4 open the usd price at the beginning of the minute 5 high the highest usd price during the minute 6 low the lowest usd price during the minute 7 close the usd price at the end of the minute 8 volume the number of cryptoasset u units traded during the minute 9 vwap the volume weighted average price for the minute 10 target 15 minute residualized returns see the prediction and evaluation section of this notebook for details of how the target is calculated 10 weight weight defined by the competition hosts here 11 asset name human readable asset name indexing the dataframe is indexed by timestamp and sorted from oldest to newest the first row starts at the first timestamp available on the exchange which is july 2017 for the longest running pairs enjoy yourself and thank you in advance for your support this is not an easy system to maintain
qk6h7n,0,how does ai fit into the metaverse future what are popular applications and research topics of ai relevant for vr ar as an ml engineer i am interested in learning more about ml topics that are could be useful for building vr software and hardware this is meant to be an open ended question so all kinds of opinions and perspectives will be appreciated thanks
qrpx36,0,integrate your ml model with your favorite apps from a single python file hi all many here can build a simple machine learning model to predict whether a customer will churn if they get a nice pandas dataframe with customer data however it gets really complicated if you want this model deployed and integrated in production say a procedure as such 1 pull data from a new customer from shopify 2 predict for this customer whether they will churn 3 if we predict churn true 4 send a discount code to this customer with mailchimp suddenly we have to code data integrations etl pipelines deploy our original machine learning solution spin up an http server etc a huge pain indeed we are building a framework that takes care of exactly all the boring stuff described above we really believe this will bridge the gap between research and real world ml super excited to share this with all of you please let me know if you have comments or feedback
rqwf4e,1,classification and object detection question i have built an object detector that is detecting birds at my bird feeder it is trained only for birds in general and without any regard for species in order to classify my data i am running a classification model on another computer with the data retrieved from the database of the detections x200b i am wondering if this is counterintuitive should i be trying to train my object detection model yolov4 running on a jetson nano to also perform the object detections with respect to species or am i on point with developing a classifier on a more powerful pc to handle the species classification
rw3nba,1,ml at home hi dudes i would like to know if you do ml at home what do you do if the answer is yes do you compute in the cloud or on your pc
rrxtnj,1,question about ml approaches hello guys a bit of context i am currently searching for a way to estimate the sex m f and he age slice kid young adult adult old of a person based on a full body picture with mask 80 success would be enough i have found many approaches giving a sufficient result analyzing the face without mask but based on the current situation this is out of the question the result on masked people are obviously terrible question are there existing repositories out there solving this particular problem and if there are not as i am a beginner do you believe that problem could be solved by training a model i e will i be able to get a working solution after learning how the whole process works
rab8fe,1,discussion about applications of deeplearning i have to questions related to each other i have just completed my course in deeplearning without any background about ai or machine learning and i really understand it so when i made my model is that has any affect like do i have not enough informations when i design my models and the second thing as i told you i have just finished my course can anyone suggest to me a ink or page for a suggestions ideas or projects for the types of models application idea for ann cnn rnn som autoencoder rbm so i can expand my ideas about real life situation application
r7wdou,1,i need help understanding the meaning of the loss values of wgan with gradient penalty hey guys i am currently working on training a auxiliary classifier wasserstein gan with gradient penalty i based my implementation off of to which i added the auxiliary classifier functionality i have a model trained off of quite a few epochs of emoji images and i am now trying to filter out bad or vice versa good samples from the set of generated examples i understand that the best way to automatically do this is to utilize the trained discriminator and its loss values to evaluate the fakeness of the images in order to be able to select ones that are able to fool the discriminator now i understand that the discriminator using the wasserstein distance attempts to separate the loss values of fake samples as much as possible from the ones of real samples given that my discriminator output for a randomly chosen set of generated images looks something like the below table i think that the images with maximum or minimum values should be the highest and lowest graded examples 22 96732 12 37780 23 39248 44 45711 14 15668 11 19169 35 99777 9 65943 16 71531 9 35125 25 98240 4 36232 8 58446 24 78805 7 47653 19 14746 28 33695 30 18404 2 67499 8 63077 this should mean that my most fake and most real generated image are the samples with 44 4 or 2 67 but neither of these outliers are particularly more real looking than the other and both look much worse than randomly chosen examples see here how should i interpret these loss values would it make sense to go for a median loss value to get more of the good looking average loss images if so why would it make sense to run a 2 means clustering algorithm on the losses to try and separate realistic and fake samples anyways thanks in advance for your help
r6789x,1,how to autusave or resume training after google colab shutting down brutly i am new to google colab and have bought a colab pro member i found it can run around 24 36 hours but brutly shut down each time you know after that i have to retrain all my gan sometimes i would download the pkl file manually and upload it to retrain but it looks stupid is there a way to autosave pkl files in google drive during each gan training snapcount thanks a lot
