rktqol,1,are there any papers on this i was recently training a sentence classifier and discovered something kind of interesting if you calculate the distance from the weights of the word embeddings at the start of training to the weights at the end of training the distance corresponds to how important that word is for the classification task i was wondering if there is any research into this it seems like it would be useful for model explainability
r8r8qr,1,is there anywhere a offline running text to speech that works on linux and has a german male voice every single text to speech i find is either googles shitty gtts which requires internet and only has 1 female voice for german or pyttsx3 which works fine on windows with a german male voice but not on linux the only german voice is a horrible robotic sounding 1960 voice unless there is a way to get the windows voices to linux to use with pyttsx3 is there anything else
qsl5jj,0,opinion the recent paper on buggy resizing libraries is misleading a recent paper on buggy resizing libraries and surprising subtleties in fid calculation claims that the image downsampling methods of opencv tensorflow and pytorch are buggy and therefore pil should be used instead for fid estimation the corresponding twitter post was quite popular during the last week i believe that this claim and the main figure of the paper is misleading because the issue is caused by aliasing and it can be fixed by simply setting the right parameters in the functions they used x200b their main figure x200b my reproduction and fixed results bilinear on the bottom image you can see the reproduced and antialiased downsampling results in all the frameworks in all cases a single parameter modification was enough to mitigate the issue i shared the code and my complete opinion in this repository though i believe that the discussion on whether antialiasing should be a default in image libraries is valuable in my opinion none of these methods is buggy and the paper presents the issue in a sensationalist way edit just found out that there is another very thorough investigation of the same work highly recommend checking the blogpost out

rvg08w,1,bootcamp graduation project generating new cooking recipes from a list of ingredients which models could fit the task hi we re a team of four working on this datascience project and we finished our second day pretty depressed about which models could fit the task at hand we have a week and a half left to complete our project python rather than using a kaggle dataset in english we re trying to make it work with data scraped on a french website we re aiming for 20 000 recipes this is a random recipe from the website for those interested we ve been thinking about separating the whole thing into two tables here are the features we ve decided to scrap so far for each table ingredients table recipe name recipe id ingredient one row per ingredient for each recipe ingredient quantity no units of measure for now e g 500g of salt 1 spoon of oil recipes table recipe id recipe name recipe steps we re having trouble deciding if this should be a single string or a list of strings we ve had two weeks of machine deep learning in this course and have seen a fair amount of library and tools like scikit learn keras pandas numpy we ve done some research but we don t have a clear understanding of the following models we ve been thinking about using for this task and would appreciate any sort of advice or source about which way to go next very short summarize simplernn lstm and gru rnn layers are too simple to generate proper text from what i gathered word2vec too in a different way gan and transformers gpt 2 bert albert seems likes the answer but i have no idea if it s realist for us to work on it with limited time or even where to start with it for textgenrnn i did not grasp how useful it could be tablegan library did not appear to be good at generating text x200b here is a very long text about my understanding of those models i would really appreciate any advice even without you reading any of what is below x200b x200b i don t have a deep understanding of how neural networks works but from my understanding rnn aim to predict the next future at least element of a sequence mainly for time series and nlp i m familiar with using simplernn and lstm and gru layers in keras models i don t understand the concept of vanishing gradient in depth for lstm but i remember it is supposed to be slower but better than simplernn i ve been told gru is faster because it uses less parameters than lstm about textgenrnn and tablegan i never heard of those two before looking at other works on the subject of cooking recipes both are python library textgenrnn appeared to be a better choice than classic rnn models above because it could be used on strings of different lenght and trained with the whole sequence adding character per character while tablegan opposed two models and returned tabloid data as what seemed to be a cluster of ingredients which could be interesting to use vectors on like i think word2vec does went back to the tablegan article it said he used countvectorizer from scikit learn but results gave back unusable long lists of ingredients what we did with word2vec was to feed it with a large amount of processed text tokenize lemmatize and other methods i don t remember input it with a word or short sequences and it returned a dict of score as key and words as value closely related and often used with the given string i honestly don t know if the range of application for it extends to much more for gans and transformers we basically had one lone slide on it that told us it was advanced models but we couldn t cover it during the course i don t fully understand transformers what i understand is that it seems to function with both encoders and decoders doesn t resort to rnn but do use vectors i guess i need to read attention is all you need asap to further my understanding of transformers my understanding of gpt 2 bert albert and other transformers is so low at the moment gpt 2 seems to be pre trained it calculates the likelihood of a word clustering and vectors occurring after a string based on its full content i tried it on this website and it made it seem like one of the better options it might already be too good and i feel like student of our level working on it might only make it worse do you think it is possible to make it predict words in between ingredients recipe steps like tomato curry chop and oven instead of giving words following that sentence i found bert and albert while searching for the best currents nlp models the last one seems to be a lighter version of bert which while training hides random part of the full input string while training on it to avoid over fitting it also increases its performances if i am right i don t know how to start with both gan and transformers with the deadline being quite soon to be honest but i d like to focus on one or two if they re the better solution x200b we would be very grateful if you could recommend to us some models that you think could or should be used for this task it would help us a lot to limit our field of research

rgw4fr,1,class embeddings in vit i have been trying to implement the vision transformer in pytorch and there are some confusions regarding the learnable class embeddings x200b 1 how exactly does this embedding learn the corresponding label for the image 2 why do we only pass the class embedding related outputs from the transformer encoder to the mlp 3 would it not be better to get a linear projection from the transformer encoder output and input it to the mlp and ditch the class embedding entirely 4 finally how exactly can we implement it i have seen some blog posts using nn parameter class from pytorch as i understand it defines a random vector for which the the weights are learnt as the training proceeds is this the correct way x200b thanks alot

qtsomm,0,reverse language reconstructing by consensus this wasn t a priority for me for a few months as i was collecting data but it is becoming one now for the next stage of my project i have 70 000 rows x 12 columns which i ve been working on to reconstruct some of the words from classic latin currently after lemmatization there are 9000 words that are unknown in english many were unable to be lemmatized however by translating latin into every language that evolved from latin i m able to fill the pieces for instance errat in english was errat i could not find it within the dictionaries we can assume what it means but when we follow it down the line the process is latin to german to english latin to spanish to english latin to catalan to english and so on and so forth going down the list we have to err irren err to be wrong err wander err shine to rail err errar to make a mistake made a mistake fout wrong we can conclude that it means error that s obvious err would have been perfectly acceptable as it is english however i can t go through this line by line especially not by myself i have tried to create a natural language consensus for each row but it doesn t work the issue is getting it the right data i ve tried a pattern such as 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 a 2 3 a 1 a 2 1 however it spit out gibberish instead of choosing the most appropriate column it s almost impossible to tell the machine that fout wrong and made a mistake are synonyms unless i feed it a massive thesaurus that s also an easy one there s a word which has supporter journey wandering traveler repairer refresher none are the same but they illustrate a very unique definition we can see that the main subject of the translated word is to be an explorer the indirect subject is someone who supports fixes refreshes or repairs i know back in ancient times that the rich had repairmen for wagons tents anything while traveling this would most likely be that person but the word is unknown to be so the best i could expect a machine to do would be to summarize the two main ideas from all of the definitions this could be super simple and i m just overthinking or it s very complex and i m underthinking would love your suggestions and opinions i guess it could be as simple as a summarization of each row

rv5yj2,1,nn vs lookup table hi assuming one has collected the 24 pairs of the input output datasets for a target system x200b one can create a simple lookup table to describe the input output behavior and utilize this as a controller one can also train a dnn model to learn the relationship what is the benefit of using dnn in this case in my opinion for dnn one does not have to store the whole dataset for the lookup table if one gives a new input value that is not included in the training dataset the trained dnn would perform better since in the case of the lookup table the predicted output is just an extrapolated value from the previously known output any other benefits that can justify using dnn

qo8wvt,0,is it necessary to manually label desired objects in each image for object detection for example i have a dataset of thousands of images of 5 different objects and each object images already stored in different folders and i train my model on it now i give an image as input which contains all 5 of the objects and i want my model to detect all 5 of these objects in the image and draw bounding boxes around them to be able to do this when preparing my dataset do i have to label desired object in each image by drawing boxes around them and then train my model on it is there any better way to do this than manually labelling data of thousands of images
rfssk6,0,in transformers why are positional embeddings added to the tokens rather than multiplied element wise with them i think of a token as a vector describing the input word patch etc element wise multiplication of the positional embedding and token would change the token in a relative fashion whereas addition does so absolutely intuitively i would have thought that a relative modulation makes more sense how should i be thinking about addition in this context

rgykys,0,i just found out that my 1 years worth of research has already been published i m a phd student in the middle of my studies a year ago i had an idea about designing a neural network for medical image segmentation using shape priors i have done a quick literature review at that time although i admit it might not have been thorough enough and i found that no one really tried to use those shape priors before especially for the task that i wanted to use them on these descriptors would fit the specific task especially well i worked hard on the implementation designing the network architecture writing the article and understanding all the necessary mathematical proofs theorems related to this task i just submitted the article a few weeks ago no word from it yet and today i found an article on arxiv no citations that has been published this spring and basically uses the same idea for the same task as i did the network architecture is different than mine and the performance evaluation is different but the main selling point of my article the usage of these shape priors has already been published i am a bit devastated at this point because this would have been my first 1st author paper and i really put a lot of effort and thought into this only to discover that my idea has already been discovered before obviously i need to do a much more thorough literature review next time so that this doesn t happen again but besides that i don t know what else i could do to mitigate the damage that has been done to my motivation i am even considering quitting phd at this moment because i feel like i wasted a lot of time because of my stupidity has anything similar happened to you before do you have any advice how could you cope with similar issues in your career

rfczeg,1,what happens to the output of the two lstm s in a bidirectional lstm i m implementing a blstm but i m confused as to what happens to the output of the 2 lstm forward and backward supposed we have 3 words each with a 4 length embedding i e input is of the form 4x3 one group of people say that the output of the two lstm s is concactenated i e the 4x3 goes through each lstm independently suppose their output is 4 and a 4x3 matrix is output for each lstm the result is conactenated fully meaning the result is a 12 length vector another group says that the output of the two lstms goes through an activation function independently meaning the output of the two lstm s two 4x3 matrices go through an activation function each word at a time for the first word fore example you have 4 4 inputs to the activation function another group say the output is just concactenated on a word by word basis meaning the final output is an 8x3 matrix 4 from forward and 4 from backward what i m currently using the older papers use a mix of these with the original paper using something closer to the third option thanks

qvfn86,0,heterogeneous processor architectures and machine learning the recently introduced intel alder lake processors and less relevantly to this application apple silicon take a new approach to processor design by providing two types of cores on the same cpu die on one side full sized high performance cores optimized for single core performance high clock rates and full support for smt on the other side smaller more energy efficient cores that make some performance compromises yet aim to be capable for more parallel tasks for the machine learning community these intel processors are really only relevant for prototyping workstations equipped with one or two gpus they don’t scale to large production servers for someone intending to build a machine like this the intel 12900k and amd 5950x may be the most interesting contenders for processor choice as they deliver high performance without falling into the much more expensive workstation class xeon and threadripper processors intel has a slight edge on single core performance on most synthetic benchmarks but things are unclear when it comes to multi core performance no clear winner emerges this is somewhat digressing but there is also a discussion to be had about new forward looking features on the intel platform pcie 5 0 and ddr5 support — a set of upsides that also come with the early adopter instability and price inflation — versus the stable affordable yet not forward compatible status of amd’s am4 platform as far as i am aware not much discussion has taken place over how an heterogeneous architecture might translate to training and inference workloads a lot of the press covering these new processors focus on gaming i have to admit i am myself not very well versed in the ways cpu side parallelism is leveraged in these tasks so the impact this might have on performance is not obvious to me correct scheduling assigning performance cores to the threads that actually need them likely is a part of this — meaning operating systems matter here i vaguely know certain models and architectures rnns rl and data related tasks augmentation and pre loading are more strongly tied to cpu performance i would be curious to have peoples’ perspectives and insights on this

r8kfpf,0,dynamic batching for gpt j api hi i created a small fastapi back end for gpt j on huggingface with dynamic batching dynamic batching has the potential to increase throughput at the expense of the latency because it pads all the sequences in the batch to the length of the longest one in this project i determined the maximum amount of tokens batch size x sequence length that could fit in the memory by tuning the batch size while keeping the sequence length fixed until i would get the out of memory errors if anyone knows of a more reliable way to determine the optimal batch size i would appreciate any pointers the purpose of this project is to show how to implement dynamic batching for real production environments you should probably use c or go instead of python fastapi github link blog post

rgcrfj,0,zenml an extensible open source framework to create reproducible machine learning pipelines hey everyone i wanted to share with you an open source tool we ve been building over here in munich called zenml zenml is an extensible open source mlops framework to create production ready machine learning pipelines it has a simple flexible syntax is cloud and tooling agnostic and has interfaces abstractions that are catered towards ml workflows i think the metaflow project has similar goals but there are differences in approach not just in constructing the pipelines but also the abstraction layers provided for the underlying infrastructure could you feedback us on the vision it goes something like this create pipelines and deploy them on any stack with the above code there are of course other tools out there that look similar to the above but because zenml is focused on ml workflows here are some key advantages pipelines are data dependent rather than task dependent this means that artifacts flowing through pipelines can be modeled in a specific way to enable features like caching and lineage artifacts flowing through pipeline steps can be standardized adding a standard validation and deployment step for standard data and model artifacts steps can be standardized to enable the same effect you can then enable special features for certain steps e g distributed training for the trainer step zenml can materialize read write common objects like pandas dataframes and pytorch modules automatically regardless of the environment in which this pipeline is running local or in the cloud the data scientist can then use these objects natively as they always do this sets zenml apart from tools like airflow luigi prefect that are focused on data engineering use cases and hard to implement for ml specific tasks by both developers and data scientists all this is from the point of view of an application but what about infrastructure even with all the advantages above these pipelines and integrations need to work across varied environments and infrastructure requirements for any use case this is where the notion of a mlops stack comes in happy for feedback and looking actively for contributors create complex mlops stacks within your application we can then simply do zenml stack up this spins up the infrastructure for you on a target of your choosing in addition zenml takes care of deploying your pipelines to the relevant stack automatically e g try spinning up a kubeflow based stack on your local machine with this simple command zenml will build the container for you create the kubeflow pipeline and run it automatically with a simple command in the future we hope to expand this to include more complex deployments so what do you think links below github a star would be appreciated why docs

r8v65d,1,career advice how can i best prepare myself to get a purely r d data science position i am currently in the last semester of my master s and i was hoping to get a taste of industry for a couple years before pursing a phd or perhaps to pursue it part time either way my goal is to secure a data science position focused on performing research and with the potential to publish papers not just deploy and maintain models big data i have an offer to work as an associate data scientist at a local startup but they made it clear i would be spending half my time doing development and the other half r d the data science team is just two people and is just starting out so i m somewhat concerned that i won t have much opportunity to expand my ml skill set there however i also have a good chance of securing a full time research intern position through a government organization that my research advisor is involved with but the position is only for six months even so another opportunity could arise after this or i ll have an extra six months to hunt for jobs i m wondering a couple things 1 is a research intern position through a government org considered industry experience in regards to hiring managers i d like to not be restricted to applying to entry level positions 2 would it be better to obtain industry experience at the start up even if there s a chance i mostly won t be doing r d or to get more experience doing full time research even if it s temporary 3 is it plausible to secure a position doing 100 r d without a phd which of these options would be a better stepping stone towards that

rhiqoc,0,project ru dalle diffusion better images from ru dalle with diffusion decoder link i previously posted this project which uses a ddpm instead of vqgan for the decoder layer this new model applies the same idea to ru dalle the ddpm model can produce much more detailed images compared to the default vqgan realesrgan setup decoding from the exact same image embeddings because the ddpm model is trained on 256px images with 16x16 token dimensions it will output 512px images when given 32x32 tokens from ru dalle the model architecture is the same as before i took the pretrained ddpm models released by openai and modified the middle block to take image embeddings as input fine tuning the pre existing openai model allows me to train it in a reasonable amount of time on a prosumer ml rig but it constrains certain architectural decisions specifically the middle block must take embeddings with 8x8 dims we do one downscale pass on the 16x16 embeddings it should be possible to get better performance with fewer parameters with a custom ddpm that s matched to the image embedding dimensions

r15jix,0,has anyone used algorithmia as a model deployment tool i m unconvinced by it algorithmia advertises themselves as an mlops platform for data scientists and they provide an easy way to host models on a scalable rest api this sounds like a perfect solution for a data scientist or hobbyist who wants to host models for cheap and not worry about the devops but as i ve gotten more familiar with it i have more questions for the base tier algorithmia requires you to host your model s request handling code on a github repository owned by them a separate repository for your request handling code seems like a strange pattern to develop in they also encourage you to develop in their web ui again another pattern that feels forced they also have an ominous section in their terms of service that says you do not transfer ownership of the software to algorithmia but you do hereby grant algorithmia a fully paid up and royalty free license to use and permit others to use the software which feels overly aggressive for forcing you to use their source hosting between an unnatural development environment and a sketchy ownership clause i m reluctant to continue using algorithmia has anyone had similar experiences with algorithmia am i just being overly skittish and misinterpreting the ownership clause are their better repository patterns git subtrees that other people have used with them are there better companies to host models or should i have never even attempted leaving the aws and gcp hosting land
rfvb02,0,advice on stabilizing unstable dqn card playing agent i m attempting to train a reinforcement learning agent to play the game sushi go using deep q learning with a memory recall buffer and separate model and target networks in its current form the q network takes as input a 25 element state vector and returns a 12 element vector of action values with one hidden layer in between all layers are fully connected with relu activation functions i ve been doing a search to tune the size of the hidden layer trying values between 15 and 30 neurons my methodology is to run five trials per network configuration as follows starting with a randomly initialized network run 2 500 training games then evaluate the resultant performance over 10 trials of 100 games each while doing this search though i noticed that the network s behavior is wildly unstable starting from a randomly initialized model no seed the same network configuration will sometimes reach a 90 win rate after playing 2 500 games while other times it will quickly plateau at a 10 win rate and show no improvement i ve tried longer trials 25 000 or 50 000 games for example and seen similarly unstable results anybody have any advice for tuning this performance i ve tried adding an additional hidden layer to similar results my next best guess is to start playing around with the state vector any thoughts are appreciated

rtymaq,1,ml map predicting hello i m not sure if this is the right place to post this but i ll give it a shot anyway i play game called warframe which is really fun but one of the ways you can progress is to open something called dragon vaults and the only way to do that is to go into a map and search for a door that randomly spawns around the map it normally takes me 5 to 10 minutes to find it which is way too long considering what you get i was thinking of doing a bunch of runs maybe even crowdsourcing taking screenshots of the map screen labeling where the dragonvault was and then feeding it back through ml to see if it can predict where the dragonvault will be because most things in games aren t actually random and there are some patterns i have noticed and i m not that good at pattern recognition

rmx04g,1,what is k means clustering a 2 minute visual guide x200b x200b 🔵 k means clustering 🔵 🔱 the k means algorithm divides n data points into k disjoint clusters it is a well known unsupervised learning model this means that the k means algorithm only requires the data points and does not need the corresponding cluster that each point belongs to as this is what the algorithm figures out ✨ the clusters are found by allocating points in such a way that the total variance of the points within each cluster intra cluster variance is reduced or minimized although it iterates quite fast the k means algorithm can have varying cluster formations based on the initialization it has been widely implemented in many software packages the scikit learn package for python is the one that i have used most often 🔁 the most common method to perform the clustering is iterative it alternates between two steps 1 assigning each point to a cluster based on the point s closeness or distance to the cluster center and 2 updating the cluster center called mean or centroid hence the name k means one for each of the k clusters based on all the points that belong to this particular cluster the iterations are usually performed until the centroids stabilize converge between consecutive iterations 🤓 k means is popular in scenarios where the data is known to consist of multiple groups distributions but it is unknown which point belongs to which group cluster it can be used for data analysis and splitting data that comes from multiple distributions image segmentation color quantization among other things i have been studying and practicing machine learning and computer vision for 7 years as time has passed i have realized more and more the power of data driven decision making seeing firsthand what ml is capable of i have personally felt that it can be a great inter disciplinary tool to automate workflows i will bring up different topics of ml in the form of short notes which can be of interest to existing practitioners and fresh enthusiasts alike the posts will cover topics like statistics linear algebra probability data representation modeling computer vision among other things i want this to be an incremental journey starting from the basics and building up to more complex ideas i wanted something where i would have more of a personal touch so i decided to have them as hand written notes with self drawn figures it takes time to create a post from deciding the content making it concise and coming up with ideas on how to best convey with illustrations i wanted to give something that reaches a wider audience a shot so here i am if you like such content and would like to steer the topics i cover feel free to suggest topics you would like to know more about in the comments

rc44cl,0,best in style transfer for distributions hi everyone i am working on a style transfer project inspired by the recent results of toonification projects based on stylegan e g 1 now all of the stylegan based papers that i ve seen use a reference image for the style transfer which on the one hand is great in that it s flexible but on the other hand it s not great because the reference image has too much of an influence on the output image for example in the toonification case it could change the color of the person s hair in the toon version to match the reference image even though the toon dataset may have had a more similar hair color within its distrubtion i know that a more straightforward approach to solve the style transfer problem between 2 distributions is something like cyclegan or the many architectures it influenced however from what i ve seen none of those seem to have as good results as the stylegan based ones thanks for the replies

rxhkxd,1,closing the data loop with dagshub annotations and label studio hey r learnmachinelearning nir from dagshub here i know working on data is less attractive than building a cool model the reality though is that many times improving your data leads to much better results maybe one of the reasons we don’t do it as much is that working on data complicates our workflow significantly dagshub is the place to build data science projects it’s like github but for data models experiments notebooks and pipelines not just code we recently launched dagshub annotations which lets you easily annotate data without needing to set anything up just push data open a labeling workspace with a few clicks and annotate we constructed the data labeling workflow to smoothly connect with your gitflow requiring zero adjustments you can check out the tutorial i wrote which is beginner friendly on how to get started with dagshub annotations spoiler alert you get to annotate elon musk 🤫 check it out here would love to hear your thoughts

rcqvzh,1,how do games like while true learn help you learn machine learning i ve seen others but this game specifically was given for free at epic games basically at least for the first 20 or so puzzles you get a random input of shapes colors and you have to sort them to the outputs using decision trees if x up if y down else random expert systems if x up else down and others similars to fulfill the output requirements like red or blue any only red only red or blue triangles and green circles and so on i ve been playing and while i understand that the puzzles and logic behind it do have a relation with machine learning basics how could ml concepts be applied in solving those kind of puzzles how can you develop the logic path used in the game to apply that in ml i understand that you cannot build a ml system just by playing a game like this i know it involves a lot more between structure logic data treatment data collection and so on just wanted to ask about how those relate because playing that game and there are others its just that i personally tried this one but it can apply to others i usually just try sorting them out balancing outputs until i get satisfying solutions from my experience with programming and electronics i know this is not the way

rfhwpn,0,what happens to the output of the two lstm s in a bidirectional lstm i m implementing a blstm but i m confused as to what happens to the output of the 2 lstm s forward and backward suppose we have 3 words each with a 4 length embedding i e input is of the form 4x3 one group of people say that the output of the two lstm s is serially concatenated i e the 4x3 goes through each lstm independently suppose their output is 4 and a 4x3 matrix is output for each lstm the result is concatenated fully meaning the result is a 12 length vector another group says that the output of the two lstms goes through an activation function independently meaning the output of the two lstm s two 4x3 matrices go through an activation function each word at a time for the first word for example you have 4 4 inputs to the activation function another group say the output is just concatenated on a word by word basis meaning the final output is an 8x3 matrix 4 from forward and 4 from backward what i m currently using the papers use a mix of these with the original paper using something closer to the third option thanks

r29dv7,1,analysis of micro macro data i am trying to run some analyses on data with a somewhat peculiar structure and i am hoping that someone on this sub can help me identify relevant resources i have nested data where approximately 10 000 repeated measurements are nested within 400 individuals some individuals have one observation whereas others have hundreds of repeated measurements the weird part is that the outcome a binary outcome variable is at the level of the individual i e i have 10000 rows of data but i am only trying to predict values that varies across 400 unique individuals my initial research into this suggested that i can just make sure that my test train split prevents any one individual from contributing observations to both the train and test data i tried this with random forest using all 10000 rows and obtain near perfect prediction for my training set auc near 1 but not for my training set auc of 60 this remained true after iterating through varied hyperparameter values of note creating a test and train split while ignoring dependence between observations leads to great performance across both datasets but i don t trust it one bit next i tried to average my features such that my data now only contained one row per person it s heart breaking to see all of this data disappear i now get random forest that performs about the same on test and training sets auc of 60 i want to continue experimenting with other models or perhaps some feature engineering to see if i can improve prediction metrics however i am not sure which approach i should prioritize when experimenting evaluating whether the model generalizes independent cases feels absolutely right this is what i would want the model to be used for if it is ever rolled out in the real world getting similar performance estimates between my train and test data also make me think that anything i learn during tuning will generalize to my training set however i wonder if i can do more with my repeated data than compute means for each person feature also iccs are all over the place for my features which would suggest that for some features there isn t much individual level variability for me capture reliably i was able to find a paper that suggests a latent variable approach with this data structure is anyone on this sub aware of a similar ressource pertaining to applying machine learning to a comparable data structure surely there must be something out there but i am failing to find it even just reading a paper that seems to successfully deal with this issue would be helpful thank in advance oh and happy thanksgiving 🦃

qm6ieq,0,discussion applied machine learning implementation debate is oop approach towards data preprocessing in python an overkill tl dr i am trying to find ways to standardise the way we solve things in my data science team setting common workflows and conventions to illustrate the case i expose a probably over engineered oop solution for preprocessing data the oop proposal is neither relevant nor important and i will be happy to do things differently i actually apply a functional approach myself when working alone the main interest here is to trigger conversations towards proper project and software architecture patterns and best practices among the data science community context i am working as a data scientist in a big company and i am trying as hard as i can to set some best practices and protocols to standardise the way we do things within my team ergo changing the extensively spread and overused jupyter notebook practices and start building a proper workflow and reusable set of tools in particular the idea is to define a common way of doing things workflow protocol over 100s of projects implementations so anyone can jump in and understand whats going on as the way of doing so has been enforced by process definition as of today every data scientist in the team follows a procedural approach of its own taste making it sometimes cumbersome and non obvious to understand what is going on also often times it is not easily executable and hardly replicable i have seen among the community that this is a recurrent problem eg in my own opinion many data scientist are really in the crossroad between data engineering machine learning engineering analytics and software development knowing about all but not necessarily mastering any unless you have a cs background i don t we may understand very well ml concepts and algorithms know inside out scikit learn and pytorch but there is no doubt that we sometimes lack software development basics that really help when building something bigger i have been searching general applied machine learning best practices for a while now and even if there are tons of resources for general architectures and design patterns in many other areas i have not found a clear agreement for the case the closest thing you can find is cookiecutters that just define a general project structure not detailed implementation and intention example proposed solution for preprocessing for the sake of example i would like to share a potential structured solution for processing as i believe it may well be 75 of the job this case is for the general dask or pandas processing routine not other huge big data pipes that may require other sort of solutions if by any chance this ends up being something people are willing to debate and we can together find a common framework i would be more than happy to share more examples for different processes x200b keep in mind that the proposal below could be perfectly solved with a functional approach as well the idea here is to force a team to use the same blueprint over and over again and follow the same structure and protocol even if by so the solution may be a bit over engineered the blocks are meant to be replicated many times and set a common agreement to always proceed the same way forced by the abstract class imo the final abstraction seems to be clear and it makes easy to understand whats happening in which order things are being processed etc the transformation itself main pipe is also clear and shows the steps explicitly in a typical routine there are 3 well defined steps read parse data transform data export processed data basically an etl process this could be solved in a functional way you can even go the extra mile by following pipes chained methods as brilliantly explained here it is clear the pipes approach follows the same parse→transform→export structure this level of cohesion shows a common pattern that could be defined into an abstract class this class defines the bare minimum requirements of a pipe being of course always possible to extend the functionality of any instance if needed by defining the base class as such we explicitly force a cohesive way of defining dataprocesspipe pipe naming convention may be substituted by block to avoid later confusion with scikit learn pipelines this base class contains parse data export data main pipe and process methods in short it defines a formal interface that describes what any process block pipe implementation should do a specific implementation of the former will then follow from processing base import dataprocesspipebase class pipe1 dataprocesspipebase name clean raw files 1 def init self import path export path params self import path import path self export path export path self params params def parse data self pd dataframe df pd read csv self import path return df def export data self df pd dataframe none df to csv os path join self export path index false return none def main pipe self df pd dataframe pd dataframe return df dropnan reset index drop true pipe extract name self params extract pipe time to datetime self params dt groupby foo sum reset index drop true def process self none df self parse data df self main pipe df self export data df return none with this approach the ins and outs are clear this could be one or many in both cases and specify imports exports even middle exports in the main pipe method the interface allows to use indistinctly pandas dask or any other library of choice if needed further functionality beyond the abstractmethods defined can be implemented note how parameters can be just passed from a yaml or json file for complete processing pipelines it will be needed to implement as many dataprocesspipes required this is also convenient as they can easily be then executed as follows from processing pipes import pipe1 pipe2 pipe3 class dataprocesspipeexecutor def init self sorted pipes dict self pipes sorted pipes dict def execute self for pipe in pipes items pipe process if name main params json loads parameters json pipes dict pipe1 pipe1 input1 csv output1 csv params pipe1 pipe2 pipe2 output1 csv output2 csv params pipe2 pipe3 pipe3 input3 csv output2 csv clean1 csv params pipe3 executor dataprocesspipeexecutor pipes dict executor execute conclusion even if this approach works for me i would like this to be just an example that opens conversations towards proper project and software architecture patterns and best practices among the data science community i will be more than happy to flush this idea away if a better way can be proposed and its highly standardised and replicable if any the main questions here would be does all this makes any sense whatsoever for this particular example approach is there any place resource etc where i can have some guidance or where people are discussing this thanks a lot in advance ps this first post was published on stackoverflow but was erased cause as you can see it does not define a clear question based on facts at least until the end i would still love to see if anyone is interested and can share its views

qs7g4t,0,causality research in ml is a scam warning controversial don t get me wrong causal inference are the most methods for application areas where we observe a bunch of random variable and want to figure out the causal relationship between them this rant is not about the method is itself but how ml research is recently getting exploiting the term causality for the sake of the hype and citations in ml we have two main paradigms supervised learning and rl work on causality e g bernhard schölkopf judea pearl etc tells us that is impossible to determine the causal relationship between variables if we only observe them without performing any interaction therefore with supervised learning we cannot learn a causal model but we need to impose one period regarding rl tabular q learning is guaranteed to converge to the maximum expected reward policy period that s it nothing else needs to be said about it however despite these two fundamental statements there is currently growing a hype in general ml research about causality i am completely fine with causality research as long as it focuses on the application area mentioned in my first sentence but this recent trend brings the concept into computer vision nlp etc where things become vague quite fast exaggerated by the fact that research on causality can be already extremely vague and deeply philosophical e g what s the practical implication of newcomb s paradox in computer vision no causal model is known even the vision processing of humans or animals is very little understood moreover cv tasks are inherently under specified for instance is a cartoon drawing of an elephant still an elephant or is is out of distribution ood or its own class or multiple classes are we talking about the causal relationship of pixels patches or concepts what makes an elephant ear an elephant ear this vagueness combined with the general trend in ml of throwing a bunch of overly complex math statements into a paper to impress the reviewers is really concerning i bet that there will be hundreds of papers on this topic be published in the next years that contribute very little to our understanding but will create millions of self citations

r9k1u5,0,using the singular value decomposition for compact operators in my latest paper on dynamic mode decompositions this is something i have had trouble finding in standard textbooks on operator theory and functional analysis including conway s a course in functional analysis and pedersen s analysis now it s honestly surprising to me that it is really just a few lines past some of the theorems in those texts but i ve only really located discussions in a bunch of pdf s online on the other hand even though it is core to all of data science it also doesn t appear in textbooks there either and this is probably due to the idea that all real world data is finite dimensional again it almost follows the same argument save for some infinite dimensional considerations the singular value decomposition for compact operators is a tool i ve come to use in my work that overlaps operator theory and data science namely in the convergence theories concerning dynamic mode decompositions these decompositions rely strongly on a finite rank approximation of an infinite dimensional operator and my group and i have managed to show the convergence of some of our routines using the svd for compact operators one of the papers was just published this past week and you can find it linked below available freely through this link for a limited time by the publisher in the paper linked below we introduced a scaled liouville operator that was compact over a particular rhks what s interesting is that over a compact subspace of the workspace you can get a point wise approximation of the unbounded liouville operator by a compact operator so past a certain threshold the difference between them is indistinguishable on a particular data set so to help my students and burn it into my memory i put together this video discussing the svd for compact operators here is an older video on our perspective on dmd we leverage quite strongly liouville operators and occupation kernels you can find sheldon axler and steve brunton discuss the regular svd and i ve done that before on my channel too i think this is the first video on youtube extending that discussion to compact operators though i m happy to be shown otherwise let me know what you think of the presentation cheers paper link

rlxggy,0,since gradient continues to decrease as training loss decreases why do we need to decay the learning rate too this has always bothered me i will write my question point by point to make myself more clear 1 the weight update for sgd is gradient times learning rate 2 initially when the training loss is high the gradients are naturally going to be very high usually we use high learning rate at this step 3 as the training progresses training loss falls and gradients also become smaller we usually lower the learning rate as the training progresses 4 so we are reducing the weight update through both learning rate and gradient 5 interestingly for adaptive optimization methods such as adam we normalize the gradient by it s second order moments which kind of counteracts the effect of gradients becoming smaller i m not too sure about this though 6 so my question is why do we need to decay the learning rate

rhsefd,0,anyone else suspicious concerned about the spread of data science degrees along with ms programs in artificial intelligence rather than an ms in cs stats with a focus on ai i could understand if say cmu wanted to have an out and out ms in ai which would probably be pretty good prep for a phd in the subject but for example yeshiva university has an ms in ai despite as far as i can tell having literally only two full members of the faculty working in the area so i m somewhat concerned about the rise of all these degree programs in ml ai ds specifically because they seem really specialized in a way that undergraduate professional degrees probably shouldn t be and aren t always offered by departments that i trust to deliver appropriate instruction to me it would be way more appropriate for students to do a degree in math statistics cs and then pick coursework and do research in a narrower specialty rather than potentially be left holding the bag once the hype dies down
rcy2tq,1,question about model stacking i m working on a small personal project and would like to implement model stacking however the approach by which i would like to do is proving to be unintuitive not sure if that s because it s not possible and or recommended or i just haven t stumbled across the appropriate method yet what my plan is is to split the records into one dataframe here would be good point to mention working in python that contains the numerical features and a second dataframe that contains the categorical features and maybe even keep a copy of the original dataframe with both and of course to split out the target variable all sharing the same index then run through a selection of models and feed the predictions to a meta learner i ve read a few articles about model stacking implementation via sklearn and the process seems to involve initiating a stackingregressor or stackingclassifier depending on task and passing the estimators and final estimator then fitting predicting etc in typical fashion my problem lies in the disparate dataframes it seems that you re only able to run a single x and y through the process you cannot tell the stacker to run models a and b on the numerical dataset and run models c and d on the categorical dataset correct but perhaps there may be a manual workaround
rsumxg,1,what is l1 distance a 2 minute visual guide x200b 🔵 manhattan distance 🔵 🗽you might have heard of euclidean or l2 distance but have you heard of the l1 distance also known as the manhattan distance 🚕the manhattan distance is computed by treating the geometry to be as if it were the street of manhattan one square city block followed by another so the only way to travel is to go along the right angled streets while the shortest euclidean distance between two points has a unique path the same is not the case for manhattan distance as you can have multiple paths with the same distance 🌃 mathematically the l1 distance is the sum of the absolute value of the difference of each coordinate of your point vector and can be extended to n dimensions 🤓 l1 distance or the l1 norm is also used to regularize model parameters regularization penalizes model parameters from over fitting the l1 norm forces model parameters to be sparse which would shrink the non important features towards zero the coefficients of the model could then be used to understand which features are more important i e the features that correspond to model parameters with larger values for example if you have a linear regression model with l1 regularization that predicts the price of a house with features number of rooms area color of house after fitting the model on your data you see the coefficients corresponding to number of rooms area color of house 0 5 0 6 0 01 you can see that the model treats number of rooms and area to be more important features than color of house as 0 5 0 01 and 0 6 0 01 in determining its price if you like such content and would like to steer the topics i cover feel free to suggest topics you would like to know more about in the comments

racb4q,0,optimal policies tend to seek power neurips spotlight summary there are more ways for some actions like staying alive to be optimal roughly because staying alive lets the agent do more things actions which help agents stay alive and keep their options open will provably be optimal for most reward functions the upshot is that it might be very very hard to design intelligent real world ai systems which let us deactivate and correct them if statistically most goals don’t incentivize that behavior then our goals would conflict with the goals of most smart ai agents excerpts from the paper abstract some researchers speculate that intelligent reinforcement learning rl agents would be incentivized to seek resources and power in pursuit of their objectives other researchers point out that rl agents need not have human like power seeking instincts to clarify this discussion we develop the first formal theory of the statistical tendencies of optimal policies in the context of markov decision processes we prove that certain environmental symmetries are sufficient for optimal policies to tend to seek power over the environment these symmetries exist in many environments in which the agent can be shut down or destroyed we prove that in these environments most reward functions make it optimal to seek power by keeping a range of options available and when maximizing average reward by navigating towards larger sets of potential terminal states introduction omohundro 2008 bostrom 2014 russell 2019 hypothesize that highly intelligent agents tend to seek power in pursuit of their goals such power seeking agents might gain power over humans marvin minsky imagined that an agent tasked with proving the riemann hypothesis might rationally turn the planet—along with everyone on it—into computational resources russell and norvig 2009 however another possibility is that such concerns simply arise from the anthropomorphization of ai systems lecun and zador 2019 various 2019 pinker and russell 2020 mitchell 2021 we clarify this discussion by grounding the claim that highly intelligent agents will tend to seek power in section 4 we identify optimal policies as a reasonable formalization of highly intelligent agents optimal policies tend to take an action when the action is optimal for most reward functions we expect future work to translate our theory from optimal policies to learned real world policies section 5 defines power as the ability to achieve a wide range of goals for example money is power and money is instrumentally useful for many goals conversely it s harder to pursue most goals when physically restrained and so a physically restrained person has little power an action seeks power if it leads to states where the agent has higher power we make no claims about when large scale ai power seeking behavior could become plausible instead we consider the theoretical consequences of optimal action in mdps section 6 shows that power seeking tendencies arise not from anthropomorphism but from certain graphical symmetries present in many mdps these symmetries automatically occur in many environments where the agent can be shut down or destroyed yielding broad applicability of our main result theorem 6 13 conclusion many real world environments have symmetries which produce power seeking incentives in particular optimal policies tend to seek power when the agent can be shut down or destroyed seeking control over the environment will often involve resisting shutdown and perhaps monopolizing resources we caution that many real world tasks are partially observable and that learned policies are rarely optimal our results do not mathematically prove that hypothetical superintelligent ai agents will seek power however we hope that this work will foster thoughtful serious and rigorous discussion of this possibility links paper neurips recorded spotlight presentation neurips poster session tue 7 dec 8 30 a m pst spot d3 in gather town series of blog posts on this line of work twitter thread

qrte64,0,why do we have to discretize the data before we use mask prediction for representation learning in fields as vision or speech a lot of recent papers learn representations by masking parts of the input and predicting the original to do this they often refer to masked language modeling mlm in bert style pre training and say that we must first discretize the continuous input into discrete tokens e g using a vq vae before making predictions i e classification task over possible tokens in the dictionary one of the argument is that the predicting discrete tokens allows the model to learn high level concepts whereas making prediction in the original input space e g raw pixels will force the model to learn high frequency low level details that are not useful for representation learning compression and is also computationally prohibitive since the original input space is likely very high dimensional however my question is why can t we do regression in a continuous latent space for the masked positions e g predicting the latent representation of a learned continuous vae for the masked positions instead of classification in a discrete latent space e g predicting the discrete tokens of a learned vq vae for the masked positions is there any theoretical advantage to using discrete tokens instead of continuous latents

r5o8q0,1,what is this parameter tuning method called does it work hello i work for the meteorological service of canada suppose i want to tune some parameters for a prediction system however this is for a heavy prediction system like weather forecasting and the supercomputer takes an hour to finish one run then we get a score result for how good the prediction was there s ten parameters to tune which parameters should we try next how about training a nn even just on a few examples to model which parameters will output which scores we then use the nn to try thousands of combinations of parameters the next set of parameters we run for an hour for real are the best parameters according to the nn guess after the hour run we retrain the nn on the new example repeat is there a name for this does it work well example articles or discussions is there some better way thanks

raen75,1,training to produce a text file dipping my toes into your world i am looking for some guidance from this community i have never used machine learning for anything but i think i have a use case for it and am hoping someone could steer me in the right direction background programming background is mostly in the c and python languages plus shell scripting for glue c for embedded programming and python as a general purpose programming language i have experience with some of the most popular dashboard libraries for python problem i have something like 100 examples of configuration files that are mostly generated based off of the contents of 1 file if i have 100 example test cases each will have a unique config source file pairing currently all new configuration files are filled out by hand and while i could partially automate it the way i have in the past parsing through the files i d like to see if i can learn something new and approach the problem from a machine learning perspective are there specific types of libraries for training a model to consume and produce simple text files is this an appropriate use case for machine learning is my training sample set too small have i overthought the problem would this require more work than it s worth any thoughts or criticism is appreciated

rf1kph,1,need help making a transformer model and alterations to make to it using tensorflow on googlecolab i have been assigned to come up with some creative solutions for a neural network first how should i get started to make a transformer model most of the code is made for me i just have to build the model itself compile it and fit it next is more or less just trying out a bunch of different experiments or approaches and seeing how they affect the data what are some cool or interesting things i could add to my neural network to see how they would affect the outcome i d recommend exploring ideas and analysis options by conducting a series of experiments or data analyses in each experiment you make a change to how you are analyzing the data you might use a different optimizer or add another layer to your network which changes you make should be guided by questions or problems you encounter for example your model s accuracy might be low and you might try to improve accuracy by adding a new layer to your network for another example if you observe overfitting in your model you might try adding a regularizer to reduce overfitting you then observe the effect of each change you make on the data analysis so you can evaluate what the change does for example does adding another layer to the network improve accuracy does it also increase overfitting

ruvgva,1,💊your daily dose of machine learning opencv this is a series of posts that i post almost daily i call them “your daily dose of machine learning” if you’ve worked on image processing projects before then you probably heard of opencv it’s a very cool framework for doing all sorts of things related to computer vision some of the things you can do with opencv include basic image processing techniques such as applying filters blurring edge enhancement … depth estimation using stereo cameras extracting features and computing descriptors for images classical machine learning such as linear regression svm bag of visual words deep learning for image classification and object detection although opencv is not a machine learning framework it still offers a variety of tools to build some powerful ml applications can opencv replace tensorflow in your codebase not really but if you’re already using opencv in your codebase then it’s worth taking a look at it’s ml capabilities and you might be surprised by what it can do i’ll share more insights about opencv in the upcoming days so stay tuned connect with me on your favorite social network

rhwua0,1,undersampling in r hi guys x200b i have a highly unbalanced dataset 93 accuracy on zeror and i want to undersample it a bit to reduce zeror accuracy for demonstration purposes in a data analytics course in uni x200b however i m uncertain how to go about it first of all how much should i remove of the overrepresented value and how do i do it x200b i kinda want to just cut maybe 30 of the overrepresented data simply by sorting the dataframe by target true false and then delete the bottom 30 of the values by their row number as the data is super jumbled anyways so sorting by target true and deleting bottom values removes a relatively random cut of the target false rows target false is the overrepresented value also how do i actually remove a set amount of rows based on the row number lol

ricr2w,1,is gaussian likelihood loss equivalent to mse loss for a vae in this tutorial it appears that the author uses gaussian likelihood with a log scale as a reconstruction loss and explains it as the likelihood of encountering that image if you cannot view the link the code is here see the gaussian likelihood function and recon loss other vae implementations typically use the mse as a reconstruction loss instead and the typical justification is that they are equivalent for a gaussian distribution other places i ve seen dismiss mse as a reconstruction loss e g this link which states it s basically a gaussian with a fixed variance which from what i understand is not the same as what is implemented in the tutorial which is sampling from a gaussian distribution with a dynamic variance for what it s worth i swapped out the gaussian likelihood loss with an mseloss and it didn t perform as well the kl term basically went down to 0 almost immediately as did the reconstruction loss with the original implementation though it was significantly better and the kl term kept increasing over time i m rather new to vaes and a bit bad at statistics so i m most likely missing something what is the reason for this discrepancy

rr17f9,0,4 5 times faster hugging face transformer inference by modifying some python ast recently 🤗 hugging face people have released a commercial product called infinity to perform inference with very high performance aka very fast compared to pytorch fastapi deployment unfortunately it’s a paid product costing 20k for one model deployed on a single machine no info on price scaling publicly available according to their product director transformer deploy is an open source alternative build over enterprise grade softwares inference server nvidia triton it takes queries and passes them to an engine plus adds features useful for inference like dynamic batching or multi inference engine dispatching inference engines microsoft onnx runtime for cpu and gpu inference and nvidia tensorrt gpu only it appears that without much effort it was easy to match the very few hf infinity public benchmarks but there was still an opportunity to push inference performances further that afaik is not yet leveraged by any other oss project gpu quantization for all transformer models please find below our measures on roberta base seq len 256 batch 32 mnli dataset classification source code repo performing gpu quantization requires modifying model source code to add some specific nodes called qdq on costly operations like matrix multiplication which is both error prone boring and a good generator of technical debts you maintain yourself the source code of your modified model we have done that work manually for several models and it appeared to us that it can be made automatically by just patching the model module abstract syntax tree aka the source code on the user end performing basic quantization of a model on the gpu looks like as shown in the benchmark to get a model 4 5 times faster than vanilla pytorch it costs 0 4 accuracy point on the mnli dataset which is in many cases a reasonable tradeoff it’s also possible to not lose any accuracy the speedup will be around 3 2 faster of course the exact trade off depends on the model the dataset etc but it gives a basic idea it’s a big improvement compared to a previous version of this project where speedup was costing over 1 accuracy point behind the scene transformer source code is parsed to ast and operators like matmul or layernorm are wrapped by a quantizer linear layers are replaced by quantized versions of them some tensorrt unsupported operators are replaced etc then new source code replaces in ram the original one right now we have successfully tested the process with albert bert including minilm distilbert roberta including camembert xlm r distilroberta etc electra it should work out of the box or with very little effort for any transformer model which can be exported to onnx format regarding cpu inference quantization is very easy and supported by transformer deploy however performance on transformer are very low outside corner cases like no batch very short sequence and distilled model and last intel generation cpu based instance like c6 or m6 on aws are quite expensive compared to a cheap gpu like nvidia t4 to say it otherwise on transformer until you are ok with slow inference and takes a small instance for a poc for instance cpu inference is probably not a good idea

r6b4uu,1,why do we need regularisation l2 or l1 norm in logistic regression as i was revising through my logistic regression notes and came around the loss minimization interpretation of logistic regression which is argmin w log 1 exp zi 1 2 lambda w 2 where zi yi wi xi summation i 1 n i know that the l2 regularisation as used in the above optimization function is used to find a balance between a good seperating hyperplane decision surface and weight coefficients that are not too large tending to infinity to be overestimated i can t seem to intuitively understand as to how regularisation is working to balance the weight coefficients to avoid overfitting underfitting also i might be having a misunderstanding here but in the loss function optimization part of the expression if we consider that we are not using any regularisation then ideally to minimise the loss function for points that are correctly seperated the weights corresponding to features should tend to infinity such the value of zi tends to infinity which results in log 1 exp zi tending to 0 so we are minimizing the sum over correctly classified points but for the same plane with infinitely big weights if a point comes out to be incorrectly classified it s loss function value will tend to infinity which makes it working against the optimisation problem so accordingly the weights should get readjusted to smaller values such that the sum of loss is minimized without the need of a regularisation term so i am really very confused as do we even need regularisation in logistic regression if yes how regularisation term in the expression is working towards balancing the weights

rm3cxf,1,i would like to ask a question about how to approach an ai project good morning x200b i would like to design an artificial intelligence that is able to improve its performance in a task by having another ai tell it what its mistakes are x200b concretely the scenario would be 3 intelligences capable of playing chess x200b intelligence 1 would not know how to play chess but it can learn by communicating with intelligence 3 intelligence 2 would not learn in any way but it is better than intelligence 1 and intelligence 3 is superior to intelligence 2 and every time it finishes the game it tells intelligence 1 what it detected as wrong x200b the ias don t have to speak in a human language for the project if they are able to communicate with a strip of ajdfgjjagfasdf asdfwgasryh tuds that works for me even if i don t understand it x200b my problem is that i know practically nothing about ml and i don t know from which angle to approach the problem although i have experience programming in fact the intelligence number 2 would be done but it is a minmax algorithm x200b a point to keep in mind is that the important thing is not that the intelligences end up being chess masters the point is to design a teacher student communication circuit that later can be extrapolated to other problems felices fiestas
r7mekf,1,in a class lost and confused greetings all x200b let’s get the disclaimers out of the way first yes this is a graded project that makes up a significant part of my class grade no i am not looking for y’all to do my homework x200b y’all i need help i am so lost i do not even know the correct question to ask i am in a machine learning college class pre requisites for the class are linear algebra probabilities stats 2 and calc 3 i’ve also got compsci classes under my belt i passed all of those with good grades for the past 12 weeks this class has been theory lecture and homework to show you can calculate the algorithm but there has been no application or functional use there is a textbook that we have not cracked open mine still has the unscratched access code inside the font cover we now have a project to do it has been discussed for the semester with the last few weeks for ‘research’ and only yesterday did we get the rubric for the presentation in under 10 days i am not the only one in the class who is lost i said i would do a presentation on financial forecasting on a data set i pulled from a public source of historical data for ease of discussion i’ll call it a 50x50 matrix – 50 numeric observations rows with 50 categories col category averages wildly vary from each other so the first thing i do is normalize them 1 col col and drop into a new matrix ok great i also know i need to break it up into training verification and active use testing picked 70 15 15 so i lop off the first 35 normalized rows i am doing this all in matlab as prescribed by the course now what instructor has said “oh that will be perfect for support vector machine ” and then a a couple days ago gave me a stack of finance time series journal article x200b what the frack do i do i don’t know where to go from here the instructor i believe could help me if i had any idea what the question was to ask i can at least get either the classification app or the ‘econometric modeler” from the computational finance app section open that the data loaded and i don’t understand anything of the outputs i just i am completely lost

qnhf5f,0,tf keras in hugging face datasets edition hi all tensorflow maintainer at hugging face here i posted here a few months ago about the big change we were making to the library to make everything keras native and people seemed to like it so i thought i d give another update on what s changed since then we ve made a couple of big changes that reduce the amount of duplicate boilerplate code in common scripts massively and we d love to get people using the new approaches and get feedback what happened in last week s episode of hugging face the story up until now is that all our models are now keras models you can still write your own training loop or use the models as a layer in a larger model everything like that remains unchanged but it s incredibly convenient to just load a model then just immediately compile and fit it i gave some examples in the post i linked above last week usually refers to times less than four months ago you aren t telling me anything that isn t already in my performance reviews don t worry at least you delivered eventually what s new so the first big new change is a really nice integration with 🤗 datasets if you re unfamiliar datasets is the data equivalent to hugging face s model hub you just load any uploaded dataset in one line of code the same way you load a pretrained model with the load dataset function it s not just for nlp people are using transformers for audio and vision and everything else these days so there s all kinds of data in there you should check it out to see an example of load dataset in action a standard workflow with datasets and transformers goes something like this from transformers import autotokenizer tfautomodelforsequenceclassification from datasets import load dataset load a pretrained model and its tokenizer model name bert base cased tokenizer autotokenizer from pretrained model name model tfautomodelforsequenceclassification from pretrained model name load a dataset we ll use the cola dataset from the glue benchmark data load dataset glue cola define a function to tokenize the data then apply it to the dataset the tokenizer returns a dict and map will add keys from that dict to the dataset as columns def tokenize function dataset return tokenizer dataset sentence tokenized dataset data map tokenize function so far so good but this is the point where problems start to arise because it s really hard to get the tokenized data into your model the data is often 1 quite large and 2 jagged because different samples will tokenize to arrays of different lengths as a result if you want to load the data as a single dict of np ndarray or tf tensor you end up having to do huge amounts of padding which bloats memory usage and massively slows down the model the way to get good performance is to load random batches of samples and only pad that batch not the entire dataset but doing that basically required you to write a custom training loop or at the very least a python generator before it would work with keras if anyone was using transformers with tf before now i d love to hear how you were solving this because it was a huge recurring pain for me so is there a solution now there is the solution is that we added the method to tf dataset to all our datasets this basically wraps the dataset in a tf data dataset which will do the just in time data padding you want we ve also updated our datacollator classes to work with this so you can generate your dataset like so from transformers import datacollatorwithpadding data collator datacollatorwithpadding tokenizer tokenizer return tensors tf tf dataset tokenized dataset train to tf dataset columns input ids attention mask labels batch size 16 shuffle true collate fn data collator note how the data collator needs your model s tokenizer that s because every god damned research group in every god damned university in every god damned country handles their data in a slightly different way and so there s no universal approach to padding that works for all of the hundreds of different models out there we do guarantee though that the tokenizer that comes with a given model will have a pad method that works for that model and that s what the data collator will use you have no idea how much pain you re being saved with that method okay calm down what do i do with this tf dataset that bit s easy a lot of people aren t that familiar with tf data but it s actually really cool once you have a tf data dataset you can pass it straight to model fit or just iterate over it in a for loop to get batches won t i need to compile this model before i can fit it what loss should i use that s a great question and that brings me to the second big change we ve made our models now automatically compute losses that are suitable for their task in a way that s accessible to keras in other words if you use tfautomodelforsequenceclassification that model will now compute a loss appropriate for sequence classification tasks i e crossentropy for you don t know what loss you need to train gpt 2 with no problem tfautomodelforcausallm from pretrained gpt2 will do it for you wait stop i m an advanced user and i want my loss not your loss don t panic you can still use whatever loss you want and all old code will work exactly as it did before the only change is that if you compile your model without a loss it ll interpret that as you wanting the default internal loss if you specify a loss argument to compile then it ll use that and not the internal loss in addition this only applies when using the keras api like fit if you re writing manual training loops or using the model as a layer in a larger model none of this is relevant to you this is just a convenience and it s easy to disable so i just skip the loss argument exactly if we continue on the code samples from above all you need to do is from tensorflow keras optimizers import adam optimizer adam 3e 5 transformers work much better with lower lrs model compile optimizer optimizer no loss argument model fit tf dataset and that s it dataset loaded tokenized and trained on with changes to a few lines almost any nlp task from translation to token classification or summarization can be handled in a similar way if you want to see more we have a bunch of example notebooks in both tensorflow and pytorch and all the tf examples should be up to date with these new methods
r7x490,1,is it always necessary to retrain a model on an entire dataset to further elaborate on this question i will give an example let s say we have a dataset consisting of 1000 datapoints we have trained a model on this data we deploy it and it starts making predictions every week however we gather more and more data lets say 250 new datapoints every week to improve our model we want the model to learn from these new points is it necessary to retrain the model on these 1250 datapoints or is there someway to keep its original learning and only have it additionally learn from these 250 points i can imagine that for a smaller dataset this does not really matter but once you get to much bigger datasets this can be a very costly process to have to retrain a model on all the data
rga91a,0,are you using pytorch or tensorflow going into 2022 pytorch tensorflow and both of their ecosystems have been developing so quickly that i thought it was time to take another look at how they stack up against one another i ve been doing some analysis of how the frameworks compare and found some pretty interesting results for now pytorch is still the research framework and tensorflow is still the industry framework the majority of all papers on papers with code use pytorch while more job listings seek users of tensorflow i did a more thorough analysis of the relevant differences between the two frameworks which you can read here if you re interested which framework are you using going into 2022 how do you think jax haiku will compete with pytorch and tensorflow in the coming years i d love to hear your thoughts

rhwofs,0,is it right to use your phd student as an expert annotator on a dataset creation paper and not give them authorship hi guys i m sure you ve seen the recent discussions about the role of datawork in ml research for example here here or here some of that is definitely complicated and there s lots of room for disagreement but today i came across an example of a well known researcher choosing not to give a phd student authorship and it made me wonder what do you guys think here s the post in question the names of particular expert annotators the ones who wrote the dataset are acknowledged by name in principle that seems good i think what is surprising though is that some of these expert annotators seem to actually be phd students in the last author s department linguistics the data collection itself relied on their domain expertise presumably this is what qualifies them for the task it strikes me as questionable not to include a student in your department as an author especially when they contributed meaningfully to the dataset are we going to have a split system now where domain expertise as an active graduate level researcher isn t sufficient for authorship on the project is writing the dataset that much less important than running a model on it tl dr is it fair or fucked not to make a phd student an author on a project they worked on just because they worked on the data side of a dataset paper

riqxrq,0,do large language models understand us blog post by blaise aguera y arcas summary large language models llms represent a major advance in artificial intelligence ai and in particular toward the goal of human like artificial general intelligence agi it’s sometimes claimed though that machine learning is “just statistics” hence that progress in ai is illusory with regard to this grander ambition here i take the contrary view that llms have a great deal to teach us about the nature of language understanding intelligence sociality and personhood specifically statistics do amount to understanding in any falsifiable sense furthermore much of what we consider intelligence is inherently dialogic hence social it requires a theory of mind since the interior state of another being can only be understood through interaction no objective answer is possible to the question of when an “it” becomes a “who” — but for many people neural nets running on computers are likely to cross this threshold in the very near future
qrbkc7,0,calling out the authors of trajformer paper for claiming they published code but never doing it i read a paper from neurips 2020 titled trajformer trajectory prediction with local self attentive contexts for autonomous driving i found it interesting and the authors claim multiple times in the paper that we release our code at turns out they never did fine i thought perhaps they will in the future and starred the repo to check it out later many others raised issues asking for update on code release and they never replied finally it april they update the readme to say that they will release the code and that s been the last update i know this is a common trend in ml papers now but what sucks is that i emailed the authors both the grad student and the pi multiple times asking for an update an they never replied their paper is literally based on empirical improvements and without working code to replicate the results it is their word against mine i strongly think things have to change and i believe they only will if we call them out i waited long enough and made significant effort to contact the authors with no response i mean i don t mind them not releasing their code but at least don t claim that you did in the paper review phase and then disappear an undergrad in my lab asked why she should take time to clean up the code and document it before release while others just move on to the next interesting project and i don t have an answer

r0zvrb,1,monte carlo simulation for approximation of pi number the number π is a mathematical constant approximately equal to 3 14159 it is defined in euclidean geometry as the ratio of a circle s circumference to its diameter and also has various equivalent definitions the number appears in many formulas in all areas of mathematics and physics the earliest known use of the greek letter π to represent the ratio of a circle s circumference to its diameter was by welsh mathematician william jones in 1706 it is also referred to as archimedes s constant the simulation works on the principle of generating random points in the square of the page r 1 based on the distance of the point of the center of the coordinate system it is possible to determine whether the point is inside or outside imaginary quarters of a circle how is a quarter of the surface of a circle frac r 2 pi 4 and area of square r 2 number pi can be approximated as frac k m 4 where k is the number of points within a quarter of a circle and m is the total number of simulated random points as the number of randomly generated points increases it is possible to calculate the number pi with greater precision at the expense of time efficiency

rdb1uw,0,uttt ai alphazero like solution for playing ultimate tic tac toe in the browser tl dr i developed ai solution mcts nn inspired by alphazero for playing ultimate tic tac toe game in the browser you can try it yourself here why ever since i started working in machine learning 5 years ago i have always wanted to do some cool project for my portfolio reading scientific papers gave me plenty of ideas but only after i read alphazero preprint i knew this is it alphazero is a third paper in alphago alphago zero alphazero muzero sequence in alphazero paper deepmind generalizes previous work so that ai can learn through self play not only how to master go but also chess and shogi i had read previous papers but it was alphazero specifically that sparked my imagination probably because i love simple and elegant engineering solutions and alphazero is mostly about that i discovered ultimate tic tac toe and implemented alphazero in early 2018 after a few weeks of work i realized it s not going to be an easy ride there were two major problems that essentially made me forget about this project for a long time firstly although ultimate tic tac toe uttt looks easier than chess or go it is still quite a challenging game the average length for uttt game is somewhere between 40 and 50 plies the average number of legal actions per position is somewhere around 7 my estimate from self play data it is difficult setup for a side project one of the key factors enabling alphazero success is massive computing power 5000 tpu v1 for self play and 64 tpu v2 for training i had to figure out much cheaper way to develop interestingly good ai under my personal budget secondly when i envisioned deploying alphazero in the browser i had zero knowledge of web development and frontend in general which meant i had to find some time to learn it not easy if you already have a full time job and other stuff going on in your life i decided to put the whole project on hold and said to myself maybe one day there will be better time for this fast forward to 2021 i left my job and decided to spend a year on a career break pursuing my interests i realized that i finally had enough time and resources to conquer this project i learned the basics of web browsers html css javascript and react i bought a desktop pc i ve managed to incrementally redesign alphazero self play training into something more executable on my computer i evaluated ai and confirmed it s superior in comparison to already existing implementations that you can access online other websites and mobile apps i built a react app tested it and finally deployed this week differences from the original alphazero much smaller policy value network architecture designed specifically for playing ultimate tic tac toe in the browser with only 5 million parameters 20 mb source code total separation of self play data generation process from the policy value network training offline rl this was crucial change there is no way i could succeed with a single script that implements online rl and runs for 10 weeks on my desktop this had to be broken down into more manageable stages more mcts simulations per position for training self play data quality over quantity the initial self play dataset was generated from pure mcts simulations random playouts are faster and better than random policy value network predictions search simulations are synchronous single threaded and sequential enabled data augmentation by flipping the board during policy value network training value target for mse loss function is defined as the root s mean state value rather than the game outcome masked kl divergence loss for policy head instead of cross entropy loss auxiliary policy head loss for predicting action values next to action logits there is no external benchmark to compare my solution with so i came up with my own evaluation setup details are on the main selling point is that the final policy value network checkpoint with 1k simulations is much better and faster than mcts with random playouts and 10m simulations 4 order of magnitude difference in other words policy value network learned useful information about ultimate tic tac toe enabling better and faster evaluations i haven t found any other publicly available ai for ultimate tic tac toe that can beat the best version online i found is which implements mcts with random rollouts and some custom modifications source code it keeps up for the first 10 15 moves with uttt ai but eventually does some mistakes and losses the game sometimes there is a draw various technical details and takeways from the project is build using react onnxruntime and deployed as a azure static web app shout out to microsoft for providing great service policy value network is running in the browser on your device using webassembly backend it utilizes only cpu i wanted to use webgl backend which enables gpu access but they don t support convtranspose2d layer yet this or i have to rewrite and retrain policy value network without convtranspose2d to learn web dev frontend i read the entire course twice watched plenty of deved videos and implemented many small throwaway projects my computing hardware for developing this project was intel i7 10700k with 8 cores x 3 80ghz 2 x rtx 2080 ti 64 gb ram the onnx format is great you can load pytorch model in javascript via very easily torch jit nad libtorch are brilliant tools for using pytorch model in c works best on desktop and gaming laptops on my desktop 75 simulations sec on my laptop 70 sims sec on my phone 2 5 sim sec i created a video showing ai self play with 100 000 simulations i think about recording another video with all games from nmcts2 10k vs mcts 10m evaluation to show how mcts is dominated by nmcts2 if you don t know the ultimate tic tac toe game rules my strategy for playing ultimate tic tac toe learned from ai is as follows start in the center square of the center subgame undoubtedly the best move unless you want to surprise the opponent with something weird the o response is to push to the corner subgame so then let the next 8 moves be played in the corner subgames when the o breaks out of the corner subgames jump between the side subgames these are the least useful to take but still one has to be careful not to mess up here maintain the overall balance on the board and wait for the opponent s mistake the game is a marathon not a sprint think twice before sending your opponent to the finished subgame being able to choose any move from the unfinished subgames is very powerful

rk9s3c,1,is a linear regression model the best for my use case and if so what type and how do i do it ok so i have a data set with 200k lines of data i have a further test data set with around 100k lines with data gathered at a later time the data has three columns which i might expand in future and add a 4th there s the timestamp column the target column and then a column think it s called a feature column in ml talk that holds the data on which the target column is mostly dependent the csv header line is simply datetime usd unit price unit i visualized the data and from the graphs i can see that the price unit values have similar up and down movement as the usd unit values but it is slightly delayed by a few time intervals this is not stock data or some kind of market prediction stuff it s simply an educational data set it is clear though price units are directly linked to usd unit so while time is obviously important here the target column is directly impacted by usd unit i am trying to build a model where i can give it say the last 30 data points of both the usd unit and price unit values and it can predict the point at which the price unit which trails the usd unit in movement will catch up to usd unit i have done some reading and it looks like a linear regression model is what i need but then there are simple and multi something ones and there s all this talk about smoothing weighted averages and stuff i really don t understand i m an architect and devops engineer not a machine learning expert or mathematician i ve looked at examples of people doing this type of analysis and it just goes over my head from what i can gather python is the language of choice but then there seems to be 17 different modeling packages and frameworks and for some reason everyone starts by letting me draw a freaking graph with matplotlib while i already did that in excel it would be great if someone could guide me towards my goal please don t just point me at a linear regression for beginners tutorial i probably already saw that and it either went over my head or it just didn t work if someone is willing to take the time to explain to me what the heck i need or point me at a tutorial example and actually explain in plain simple i m a techie not a mathematician i like linux not linked differential equations oh and english is my second language english i d greatly appreciate that sorry for that i m a bit frustrated partly with the resources out there and mostly with myself for not understanding something that a lot of folks out there say is not that hard i swear i m not that dumb d thanks in advance

r9yzub,0,in your opinion what areas of deep learning are under explored while many questions still remain unanswered there have been tremendous progress in different areas such the loss landscape optimization architectures etc in your opinion what areas problems are important but haven t received much attention my opinion is that initialization doesn t get the attention it deserves it seems to me most people just accept the standard guassian i i d initialization but i think there is a lot of potential to use other initialization schemes from my own experience using the default initialization schemes pytorch offers sometimes leads the neural net to have a bottleneck where information is not propagated forwards or backwards usually after fiddling with the initialization it works wonderfully so again what in your opinion deserves attention but doesn t get it

qxz09z,0,can embodiment help ml we ve all heard the question if embodiment is necessary some claim symbol grounding occurs when a system has a body and it s therefore needed some claim that movement is the real reason we have brains some claim that it s not it seems to me this view is prevalent in the machine learning community ml practitioners claim that statistics on data alone will get us there i have a novel argument in favor of embodiment it is specifically aimed at the ml statistics community i claim that embodiment allows conducting statistical experiments as opposed to performing observations creating and conducting statistical experiments where one can control the conditions of the experiments dramatically speeds up learning in layman s terms one can hit the corner cases that might never reveal themselves if something is observed without the ability to modify the experiment for example observing a coin on a smooth building lobby floor where people are kicking it once in a while versus an ability to conduct an experiment by flipping a coin what do you think about my argument and what are your arguments for or against embodiment

rwcehg,1,best way to fuse metadata into a cnn i ve been working on a gan cnn that s producing good results apart from in one area the network takes a photograph as input and produces a stylised output as this is a supervised training model there is a ground truth the network is optimising itself toward the ground truth has different lighting to the input image and i need some way of informing the network of this so far i have tried two approaches the first is to write a column of pixels into the input image where the column s colour contains the needed lighting data the drawback to this approach is it causes artifacting in the output and the network stumbles around for a long time before learning the colour coding the second is to concatenate the input tensor just before the forward passes with an additional channel whose brightness contains the needed lighting data this might be a more appropriate solution although i m concerned it s a waste of convolution filters i would appreciate any insight that can be provided particularly on best practices thanks

rde0ti,0,codeparrot 🦜 train your own copilot from scratch we are releasing codeparrot 🦜 my first project at hugging face what is it it is a code base to build large language models for code generation from scratch it includes the code to clean up github scale datasets train gpt 2 style models from scratch on distributed infrastructure and an evaluation benchmark of openai s humaneval dataset we are also releasing two trained models and some demos to play with the models this is my first project at hugging face and i thought this is a good opportunity to talk about some of the difficulties behind the scenes of such a project which are usually not so much communicated after its release the topic of the story distributed debugging is hard the first few small experiments training gpt 2 models on a code dataset went well so we decided to scale and train the first smallish model for longer for mysterious reasons the training just stopped after a few hours not with an error but the training loop just didn t continue even more interesting when repeating the experiment it happened again but always at another step and we never observed it in experiments with fewer workers what the hell was going on after literally weeks of debugging and experimenting finally some insight i started to log everything with the maximum verbosity possible interestingly the training stop always coincided with a little debug message concerning some sort of retry it did not always stop when such a message appeared but whenever it stopped such a message was there small details matter we used a feature called streaming in the the datasets library to read the data on the fly it has a retry mechanism when reading the next chunk from a file fails it turns out that when many workers are reading from the same file and one worker fails and tries to read again there is a tiny chance for a deadlock the more workers there are the higher the chance of a deadlock which also explains why we never observed this in smaller experiments the retries could easily be avoided by changing some streaming settings and later we switched to having a single data processing worker for iterable datasets later which resolved the issue altogether and also improved training efficiency by up to 25 my main takeaways i totally underappreciated how hard and stressful the expensive debugging sessions are at scale every experiment is expensive and might take a long time to fail which limits the iteration cycle considerably distributed systems also behave very differently to simple single process programs and it takes some time to adapt the mental model all this make scaling training and models not as simple as it sounds more resources if you are curious about the what it takes to train such a model checkout the blog post for a brief tutorial on training codeparrot 🦜 also all code is open source free to use and available here if you are interested in more details about the design considerations when setting up a large dataset building efficient tokenizers and architecture choices make sure you have a look at the codeparrot 🦜 chapter in the upcoming book on transformers and nlp

raznry,1,💊your daily dose of machine learning onnx framework this is a series of posts that i post almost daily i call them “your daily dose of machine learning” last week i posted about different approaches you can use to deploy your tensorflow model in c one of these approaches is onnx runtime this week i want to share more tips and insights about it so onnx open neural network exchange is a framework or a whole ecosystem that allows for the standardization of neural networks here’s the problem that onnx is trying to solve there are many machine learning frameworks and libraries pytorch tensorflow and scikit learn are famous examples which one should you use well the answer is it depends on so many factors there is no free launch so what onnx aims to do is to make your choice easier basically you can choose whichever framework you want train your model with it and then once you’re happy with your model transform it into onnx format and keep the production code working in onnx only so onnx will help you achieve 2 things keep your options open when it comes to choosing a machine learning library for your training standardize your production code since you’ll only need to maintain one main dependency which is for onnx moreover you can use your onnx models in python c or other languages more on onnx in the upcoming days connect with me on your favorite social network x200b

ri4pqb,0,understanding alphazero neural network’s superhuman chess ability summary of the paper acquisition of chess knowledge in alphazero as a common and sometimes proven belief deep learning systems seem to learn uninterpretable representations and are far from human understanding recently some studies have highlighted the fact that this may not always be applicable and some networks may be able to learn human readable representations unfortunately this ability could merely come from the fact that these networks are exposed to human generated data so to demonstrate their ability to learn like humans and not that they are simply memorizing human created labels it is necessary to test them without any label following this idea the deepmind and google brain teams together with the 14th world chess champion vladimir kramnik studied their creature alphazero from this point of view alphazero is the descendant of alphago the super neural network that beat the world champion lee sedol in a best of five go match a turning point in the history of deep learning as can also be seen in the wonderful netflix documentary alphago unlike alphago alphazero is trained through self play i e it learns to play competing against itself and masters not only go but also chess and shogi this trait makes alphazero the perfect case study to explore this idea moreover given the fact that it performs at a superhuman level understanding its functionality is also particularly useful for highlighting unknown patterns which have never been discovered by chess theorists full paper summary by leonardo tanzi paper

quddpi,0,open accessarticle detection of bovine mastitis in raw milk using a low cost nir spectrometer and k nn algorithm we have recently published on applied science this paper which some people in the community may find interesting it is an open access therefore no one should have problems to access to it the abstract is among the bovine diseases mastitis causes high economic losses in the dairy production system nowadays detection under field conditions is mainly performed by the california mastitis test which is considered the de facto standard however this method presents with problems of slowness and the expensiveness of the chemical reactive process which is deeply dependent on an expert’s trained eye and consequently is highly imprecise the aim of this work is to propose a new method for bovine mastitis detection under field conditions the proposed method uses a low cost smartphone connected nir spectrometer which solves the aforementioned problems of slowness expert dependency and disposability of the chemical methods this method uses spectra in combination with two k nearest neighbors models the first model is used to detect the presence of mastitis while the second model classifies the positive cases into weak and strong the resulting method was validated by using a leave one out technique where the ground truth was obtained by the california mastitis test the detection model achieved an accuracy of 92 4 while the one classifying the severity showed an accuracy of 95

r3g7kd,0,looking for a sponsor for a functional programming language for new ai hardware as the 20s proceed novel ai hardware to replace gpus will arrive at the scene but by the looks of things python c seems like it will be a dominant combination for programming them this is a huge pity as we could do better than languages created in the 80s and 70s for programming hardware created in the 2020s i am trying to change this destiny with spiral apart from some special features to control inlining and specialization which make it suitable for hardware with no dynamic memory allocation capability like the gpus spiral is quite similar to languages like f and ocaml it has static typing global type inference first class functions records tuples unions and more as any competent functional language would unlike toy languages it has a well done language server if you want to try out the language it is as simple as installing its plugin in the vs code marketplace about 3 years of full time work went into it i want to make backends for novel ai chips for it but those cost money which i do not have and have restricted availability so i might not be able to get them even if i had the money but various companies will have them and if you are in the position of utilizing them and want something better than old poorly designed languages for that kind of work consider sponsoring spiral at the very least i d need access to those chips in order to make a backend for them it would really be a waste of my skills if i spent the next few years doing other things while spiral languished in the background i believe that had i made it back in the late 00s it would have become the dominant language for programming gpus and writing ml libraries in background see my resume i am a master of functional programming and i ve been researching poker rl agents since early 2021 when spiral was good enough for first release i am quite good at implementing ml papers and have from scratch written a whole gpu based deep learning based library in the past for a previous iteration of spiral making rl agents and a poker game served well to try out the new language and debug it but pretty much all i ve tried failed on full holdem to make it work i d need significantly larger batch sizes which would make training take too long on my gtx 970 so it is a matter of both not having good enough algorithms and not enough compute more broadly than just trying to make an agent for a gambling game the massive parallelism afforded by these chips could be great for game ai in general they could allow for simulating games with a large number of independently acting agents beyond deep learning better ml algorithms of the kind the brain uses would also allow for approximately storing large amounts of procedurally generated world data that would be infeasible on current hardware these algos will get here before long and when they do ml frameworks like pytorch and tensorflow will be obsolete new ones will have to be written in the current time i d like to try out various things on these chips implement the holdem game directly on them and see whether the anticipated 100 1000x speedups are enough to actually enough to make current algorithms tractable for toy games since the current algorithms are trash try to evolve something better with the aid of these chips right now i would not even think of trying this on the gpu but novel hardware might make this kind of brutish research tractable i am too dumb to go beyond backprop directly but i might be able to figure out the principles if i were given the algorithm up front unsupervised learning for making art and music i ve spent 6 5 years doing unpaid work mostly around ml and i d like to create something tangible like a game others could play for my next project i am definitely tired of my old approach of course the above would be done in spiral and to make that work at the very least i d need to create a ref counting c backend for the ai chip and probably a python backend that connects to it this would not be hard for me going into game development is my current path in order to create my assets without the help of ml i am learning to 3d sculpt and draw on my own and will move on to learning musical composition after i am done but doing it all by hand would leave me with much regret and i really should be working on things related to ai trying to do game dev feels too much like a cope for not being able to hack it in rl i still have a lingering attachment to my old path my offer to the community is thus a better way of utilizing future hardware how interested are you in and in supporting this kind of work

rp7qdv,1,project advice for recommender system that generates useful insights from random datasets hi i am currently designing a recommender system that will generate useful insights from random datasets for my course of study i have two specific problems for which i would like to hear some other people s opinion giving an example to sketch some context let s say i supply a dataset with data of all tests done by students in a class in the dataset it appears that a certain student has a higher average score than the rest of it s class the recommender system could recommend to the end user eg a teacher to plot this insight in a bar chart to make it clear to the end user that this student scores higher than the average this insight could be described as follows the combination of 1 dimension student id with 1 metric score that is aggregated as average take the average for this student the average of the metric of datatype double is significantly higher than the average of the entire column outlier insight type the five properties of the insight i have just described 1 dimension 1 metric metric datatype aggregate as average and outlier could be seen as the features of the insight just like a movie might have a genre year of production this is a simple example but you can go quite far like allowing combination of 2 dimensions with 2 metrics my idea for the system at this moment 1 intake a given dataset 2 generate the recipe for all possible insights limit amount of dimension metric combinations 3 check for all these insights what the insight type is if there is one eg outlier trend reversal you could also quantify these types as an outlier can be x higher than the rest of your column but let s not take this quantification into consideration right now 4 remove spurious insights like 100 correlation low outliers 5 rank the insights that remain with the recommender system there are only a finite amount of insights possible so the insights are all predefined and it should be possible to match insights across datasets my questions in a lot of classic recommender system examples movies are recommended to users i like to compare these movies to my insights and the users to my datasets when trying to find the analogy between my problem at hand and the classic movie user example 1 i do not know if the user dataset analogy is a good one the dataset and it s columns have their own set of features amount of columns amount of dimensions kurtosis of certain metric variance of certain metric and i would like to recommend the same insights for other datasets who have similar values for these feature but this is not what is done in collaborative filtering right normally in the classic example a user is defined by it s ratings on movies not it s inherent features age country of origin 2 a new dataset in my system won t have any ratings for insights so i am looking for a solution where i would use the dataset s distance from other datasets in the dataset space to recommend insights that were useful in other datasets with similar features to my new dataset does anyone have any ideas links tutorials readings to solve this issue i think this is a little more complicated than cold start problem because i would like to always take into account the dataset features not only during the start because of the nature of the system recommendations would also only be done once the first time a user uploads a dataset so there isn t really any way recommendations for a certain dataset would become better over time after a user has selected or rated insights

r2rn3d,1,understand tensorflow train output understand batch size parameter hello i noticed that when changing the batch size in train model the status number changes as follows for my dataset batch size 10 epoch 1 10 552 552 9s 11ms step loss 0 3074 val loss 0 0041 batch size 20 epoch 1 10 276 276 6s 12ms step loss 0 3802 val loss 0 0107 x200b so far i thought the train function will use 10 20 from the train sample and do that 10 times but now seeing the numbers 552 and 276 being anti proportional to batch size i think i got that wrong d is it in reality so that the train model slices up the train set into batch size pieces and trains all of them per epoch and the number gets smaller because now it can parallelize better and need less steps to go through them

qyy2ps,0,aesthetics of algorithmic art the idea behind our research is that we have created thousands of images each piece taking its own number of unique parameters to generate with enough votes from the public we can begin to distinguish what if any parameters make a good piece of art and adjust them accordingly we ve put together a website artvote that allows for voting on these thousands of images art is considered to be subjective but we want to find out if that s truly the case we hypothesize that there must be some aspect s to a piece that can be tailored to increase favorability and likeability when seen by large audiences as well as the individual the art you see on the website is broken down into multiple categories and although some of the pieces may look similar each one is unique it was intentionally designed in this way so that it would be easier to evaluate how small changes can impact these scores we imagine that if our hypothesis is correct that there exists a clear path in designing a piece of art or even an image this could have large impacts beyond simply generating art the advertising market would especially benefit as they can serve up more precise ads that are visually appealing to a specific user and increase click through rates
qr0rck,0,how to avoid cpu bottlenecking in pytorch training slowed by augmentations and data loading hello my colleague and i are training models on a few workstations and we are noticing some bottlenecks that are not leveraging all our gpus and stopping us from reaching full performance we are curious what techniques folks use in python pytorch to fully make use of the available cpu cores to keep the gpus saturated data loading or data formatting tricks etc firstly our systems 1 amd 3950 ryzen 128 gb ram 3x 3090 fe m2 ssds for data sets 1 intel i9 10900k 64 gb ram 2x 3090 fe m2 ssds for data sets we notice that both of our systems take the same amount of time per epoch ie we get no gains with 3 gpus vs 2 gpus which is frustrating some things we are observing cpus on both systems spike to 100 cpu on occasion but aren t always utilized disk throughput via iotop shows around 50 55 mb s max read which is way below ssd speeds surprisingly low gpu usage is very spikey here s an image of nvtop and htop for both systems some things we are doing we are using pytorch 1 10 pillow simd and the latest nvidia ngc containers we also use pytorch lighting for training we follow most of the best practices here we are setting to gradient to none instead of zero grad for performance small improvements we are setting cu dnn auto benchmark to true we are using the distributed data parallel accelerator we are using pinned memory we are using num workers 8 we see this behavior of low gpu usage without augmentations we ve reduced batch size as an experiment to see where the issues lie we are at 1 3rd max possible batch size and we see maybe a 10 20 difference in performance some things we have observed we get intermittent crashing if we increase num workers above 8 we ve noticed gpu 0 on our 3 gpu system is sometimes idle which would explain performance differences however its unclear to us why that may be similar to this issue our guess is image loading and pre processing appear to be the issue we aren t entirely sure if we are diagnosing this correctly how are folks getting around issues like these should we be pre processing our data set somehow and storing it in a more optimal format we are relying on pillow simd for image reading decoding and copying to tensors are there any good pragmatic guides to optimizing training thank you
rkla87,0,hyperparameter optimization for noise robustness imagine you propose a novel method that claims to be more robust towards label noise e g in a classification setting in the sense that its generalization performance does not suffer as much as other methods do when facing increasing degrees of noise a common scheme to demonstrate such behavior in an empirical evaluation is to vary the noise degree of the training data and report the resulting test performance of models trained on this data however many studies miss a proper hyperparameter optimization to conduct somewhat fair comparisons or they do not report the way they optimized the parameters in depth often it does not become clear to me whether the validation data think of e g single train val splits employing a cross validation makes it even less obvious is assumed to have the same noise as the training data or being a cleaner representative of the test data distribution what kind of evaluation scheme noisy train and val data clean test vs noisy train clean val and test data would be preferred when

qt90rt,0,algorithms for correlation of events issues generally any application software co exists with multiple other software where a problem with one software can have a cascading effect on some other software somewhere else in the stack e g 1 you deploy you application as a pod in kubernetes orchestration software 2 but the pod or container is not running after sometime because the ec2 machine or any virtual machine on which the pod was scheduled to run has some issues 3 the ec2 machine or the vm is having some issues because the autoscaling software that is supposed to manage the vms properly is not working correctly 4 the autoscaling software is not working correctly because of some other dependent system not doing this job 5 basically there can be a chain of issues where one issue can have a significant cascading effect on many other dependent software systems you can apply this logic to many other places imagine your application is not working properly because your load balancer is not working properly which is because you load balancer vms are having networking issues because you have some datacenter level failures etc you have all the logs files spread across the stack which reports these issues independently but usually it takes manual effort to correlate them to figure out what is the root cause typically the user sees the symptoms at a high level in the stack e g application is working properly and then they will start debugging and then finally you figure out somewhere down the stack something is wrong this usually takes specific expertise sre and takes time to arrive at the root cause basically what is happening is here is a chain of events with cascading effect there are ways to catch this using monitoring dashboards but the problem is usually those monitoring dashboard are setup in a static way manually setup and typically has a maintenance problems long term i e if there is a change in one of the software version which wants you to change a the dashboard accordingly then you might forget to modify the monitoring dashboard accordingly etc also setting up these monitoring dashboards are very specific to the problem this means you need to setup various different kinds of dashboards for different systems scenarios we want to apply ai to this problem if possible we want to come up with a well trained ai based system which can tell you which is the actual root cause issue if you give it 10 different issues that happened around a specific time interval e g we will have a model that detects various issues anomaly detection based software which we already have so we now have the list of issues that happened across the stack around a certain time interval lets say 10 issues now let s say we have 10 different issues that happens around a particular time interval 1 5 mins we would like to send all the 10 issues to ai based system and we want it to tell that out of these 10 issues 1 or 2 issues is most probably the root cause which could have caused all the other issues if we have such ai based system that will basically correlate multiple issues and tell us the root cause i e basically which of those issues is likely to have caused the other issues that will be very useful is this possible any thoughts guidance will be greatly appreciated what are all the typical algorithms approaches people apply for this kind of problem imagine a use case for this where if we have this systems i can send in a bunch of alerts coming in assume the alert has the relevant data about the issue attached to it and this ai system can process it and segregate those alerts in a such a way it informs the user which alert is actual issue which is causing other this would mean user can quickly resolve it getting rid of other alerts there are many such use cases like this

r2mi5a,0,research optimizing a kernel matrix i m experimenting with the kernel perceptron with the polynomial kernel and was wondering if there was a way to optimize the kernel matrix representation of the training set given an ordered training set x composed of n vectors from a high dimensional real space the kernel matrix m has size nxn the cell at index ij contains the result of k xi xj where k is the polynomial kernel and xi xj are the training examples at index i and j respectively a couple of observations m is a gram matrix which means that is positive semidefinite and because it is computed from real values it is real itself m is accessed only line by line due to the structure of the perceptron the total size of m increases with the square of the amount of training examples the access to the matrix is sequential therefore no amount of memoization will suffice storing the matrix in memory becomes very expensive very quickly with a training set of 60000 examples m occupies 28 8gb with 64bit floats given the simple structure of this matrix and accessing method i think is unlikely that there is no way to compute quickly a row without storing everything in memory the space saving solution would be to compute each line when needed but this is not very efficient because the algorithm is executed for a different number of epochs and with the execution may be involved some hyperparameter tuning in choosing the right kernel parameters this solution impacts very much the performance and also memory in cheaper than time a way to reduce the effective size of the kernel matrix would be to store only half of the matrix because it is symmetric and this technically works in practice is almost as efficient as not storing the matrix at all because computing a line can be done with vector oriented operations on the cpu gpu where composing the line from existing data is a strictly sequential operation and generally doesn t work that well in the end is not a good middle ground because you save half of the space but the growth rate is unchanged but the computation time for each line is almost the same as not storing the matrix

r9latm,0,thoughts on hands on machine learning with scikit learn keras tensorflow by geron i m in the early portion of my data science masters but i m wanting to learn as much as i can so i purchased the book in the title i ve noticed that some of the code as i ve progressed through chapters 2 and into 3 don t exactly work as the book expects them to is this a common problem throughout the book for instance in chapter 3 where it goes into sdg classifiers i kept getting errors for the code used on pages 86 and 88 i was able to figure out how to correct it but kind of perplexing to me how the book has these errors
qzsrtq,0,what to do when an area chair posts a new review of your paper 6 hours before the author rebuttal deadline genuinely open to advice feedback on this weird situation if the area chair over your submitted conference paper posts a new review of your paper two weeks after the initial reviews were released and 6 hours before the deadline for you as the author to make any new changes to your pdf what would you do contact the program chair about the oddity of the circumstances the situation is complicated even more by the fact that two of the original reviewers of my paper marginally voting to accept 6 s have not yet responded to my rebuttals to their initial reviews i believe i have addressed all three original reviewers main concerns questions and reviewer 2 even raised their score by a few points in response to my rebuttal bringing it to a borderline reject 5 with one small suggestion to raise their score so before this new review was released i was anticipating positive responses from the original reviewers however now that a new review has been posted last second i am a bit concerned that the scope and trajectory of the discussion forum will be diverted and diluted as a result of my new reviewer s opinions on how the paper should instead be structured which notably are quite divergent from all three original reviewers opinions any thoughts on this scenario for instance would you consider it ethical to release a paper review less than 24 hours before the author has to post a formal rebuttal in response

rmws0h,0,a mathematical framework for transformer circuits link to paper x200b in this paper we attempt to take initial very preliminary steps towards reverse engineering transformers given the incredible complexity and size of modern language models we have found it most fruitful to start with the simplest possible models and work our way up from there our aim is to discover simple algorithmic patterns motifs or frameworks that can subsequently be applied to larger and more complex models specifically in this paper we will study transformers with two layers or less which have only attention blocks – this is in contrast to a large modern transformer like gpt 3 which has 96 layers and alternates attention blocks with mlp blocks

r5a7i5,1,how to separate overlapping clusters in kmeans hello i am trying to understand how i might best approach a clustering data science problem that i have encountered where clusters overlap i will explain with a conceptual example i am conducting a study where i am trying to detect how much time is spent using different water consuming devices for lack of a better word in households such as a bath tub or a sink etc i have water consumption readers on each water using device reporting water usage levels in this case gallons minute at chronological minute intervals and so each row indicates a minute s worth of water use at each indicated gallon s minute rate i am doing this across 10 households each with its own id a dataframe of this looks like so gpm gallons per minute id gpm 0 1 43 1 1 23 2 1 54 3 1 33 134 2 44 135 2 52 136 2 63 137 2 33 245 3 23 246 3 12 247 3 15 248 3 51 356 4 22 357 4 61 358 4 54 359 4 84 as shown each household id has at each reading an attributed water consumption value given how different water using devices will have different typical water consumption levels the water consumption values in the data will likely cluster where each cluster represents a different water using device each of these households has 5 of these studied water using devices and so i am using 5 clusters the goal is to create 5 unique ranges similar to bins that i could simply drop the values of any new dataset into so that i can find the number of minute observations that fall within each water using device s range to therefore say oh this new household spent x minutes over the week using the sink and x minutes over the week using the shower etc now while i could simply just run k means on the entire dataset itself ignoring id but this would not account for the consideration that each of these households could have different models and sizes of sinks bath tubs and showers etc meaning slightly different typical water consumption values thus distorting the clusters that is why i want to run clustering on each sub dataset grouped by id so the clustering is true to that household and so i would run kmeans on the gpm values attributed to id 1 then run the next kmeans on the value values attributed to id 2 and then run the next kmeans on the value values attributed to id 3 and so on in this example lets say i have 25 unique ids with corresponding gpm values what i want to do is create all encompassing summary cluster ranges that capture all of these individual kmeans runs specifically by this i mean that for each id s kmeans run i want to produce a min and max value for each of the 5 clusters and then from that i want to produce a single range for each cluster that captures all of the values in the whole dataset this means that i want to find the minimum min value and the maximum max value for each cluster across all of the ids from this i would make the simple summary dataframe min max 0 1 2 3 4 and so this would create a cluster 1 range that would capture all of the cluster 1 values across all ids and create a cluster 2 range that would capture all of the cluster 2 values across all ids and create a cluster 3 range that would capture all of the cluster 3 values across all ids etc the big problem is that these ranges in my summary dataframe overlap in theory it seemed like my idea would work that these final summary ranges would capture all of the values in the dataset correctly but it appears there is just to much shift between how the values cluster for each id i am having a hard time trying to find what to properly label this problem as but would someone perhaps know of any ways i could address this issue so that i can produce more accurate summary cluster ranges thanks please accept my apologies if my problem was not clear i would be happy to go back and explain better

rnke9u,1,what are parametric and non parametric statistics a 2 minute visual guide x200b 🔵 parametric and non parametric statistics 🔵 🧑‍💻 if you have written code before you have heard of a parameter it is what a function takes as input to do some computation on and return an output similarly probability distributions have parameters these define the properties of the distribution 🔔 in the case of a normal distribution the mean and standard deviation are its parameters the mean controls the position of the distribution while the standard deviation controls the spread or peakiness of the bell curve ⛷️ in the parametric approach the model consists of a finite set of parameters that characterize it the big assumption that a parametric model makes is that the model will do well on the task if the underlying distribution from which your data is sampled matches the model if that is not the case the model and data mismatch will hurt the performance on the task you care about 🤸 a non parametric model does not rely on parametric assumptions and is generally more flexible it is a good choice if you don t have any prior knowledge about what could be a good model that reflects your data distribution a histogram is a good example that can model points sampled from an arbitrary distribution 🧐 however there is no free lunch you will need enough data points to get a good approximation otherwise the histogram will look nothing like the underlying distribution i have been studying and practicing machine learning and computer vision for 7 years as time has passed i have realized more and more the power of data driven decision making seeing firsthand what ml is capable of i have personally felt that it can be a great inter disciplinary tool to automate workflows i will bring up different topics of ml in the form of short notes which can be of interest to existing practitioners and fresh enthusiasts alike the posts will cover topics like statistics linear algebra probability data representation modeling computer vision among other things i want this to be an incremental journey starting from the basics and building up to more complex ideas if you like such content and would like to steer the topics i cover feel free to suggest topics you would like to know more about in the comments

r6cobf,1,💊your daily dose of machine learning tensorflow c api this is a series of posts that i post almost daily i call them “your daily dose of machine learning” last time i shared with you how i used opencv to deploy tensorflow models in a c environment today i want to share with you my experience deploying deep learning models using tensorflow c api tensorflow is built using c and it offers an api to make it relatively easier to deploy models and even train models if you wish to in c this sounds great until you start trying to implement a program that uses this api as a developer you know that the documentation is very important but tensorflow’s c api is very very very limited it’s very hard to find the information you’re looking for just by reading the documentation secondly there is no support for windows 32bits so if you have such a system then you’re facing a wall here and it’s better to try looking for other options but the great thing about this api is that you don’t have to worry about the compatibility of your model that you trained in python with the c api especially if you’re using the same version of tensorflow in python and c i’ve personally deployed image classification models and object detection models using this api and apart from the limiting factors that i mention above the models worked exactly as expected the last option that i personally tried when it comes to deploying tensorflow models in c is onnx runtime more about this in an upcoming post follow me on your favorite social network

ra4er4,1,how to capture words order in a sentence hi guys i m data science student and i m trying to capture the words order in a sentence for checking if in n triples subject predicate and object this order is respected for example given the phrase rougue is a comedy movie and given these 3 triples 1 rougue is movie 2 rougue movie is 3 movie is rogue in this example only the first triple is correct for my task i guess that in order to achieve my goal i have to vectorize the reference sentence but i don t understand how to capture the correct order so that only the first triple turns out to be right how can i do this thanks all edit my dataset for more than 90 is composed of simple sentences where the order s v o is respected so even the triples that are extracted as a second check should follow this order as a first check i thought about using the bag of words or tf idf to check the presence of the words contained in the extracted triple within the reference sentence however it is still not clear to me how to check if the word order within the triple is respected i know it s a coarse job however it serves as a basic control for skimming

r55v90,1,in a statistical learning theory setting why is the hypothesis class chosen before looking at the data in a strict statistical learning theory setting a data scientist has to do supervised classification they consult with the domain experts and choose some features which they believe to be predictive of the label they also choose a hypothesis class aka a model in which they believe contains a hypothesis having a low true error aka population error all the things mentioned above were done making use of some prior knowledge of the classification task in question the data scientist then draws a big enough i i d sample collects the data and does empirical risk minimization on it training what would be different if we choose the hypothesis class after doing data exploration or after a google search regarding which model to use i m confused about what could be thought of as prior knowledge and what cannot

rgg36d,0,results of the nethack challenge at neurips 2021 report excerpt from the results section the results of the showdown showed that — for the time being — symbolic bots red quite clearly have the upper hand in this difficult environment the top three spots in the overall best agent all went to agents from the symbolic agent track then the following three went to top of the neural agents track with the winner of this track being the only highly hybrised model in the competition alternating between symbolic and neural play depending on the proximity of monsters the margin of victory was significant with the top symbolic agent beating the top neural agent by a factor of almost 3 in the median score this was in fact increased when looking at the very best agents from each team where frequently we might see almost an order of magnitude improvement in the median score between the best symbolic and neural agents while our best symbolic teams had moderate to expert nethack domain understanding we were surprised to find they often had extensive ml experience as well in fact both winning symbolic teams said they had intended to enter the neural track but found their symbolic methods scaled much better in over half a million evaluation games no agent managed to ascend what does it all mean for ai “despite the game of nethack being far from solved by these agents seeing them descend over 20 levels deep into the dungeons of nethack to achieve scores of over 100 000 points is very encouraging past versions of nethack have a rich history of symbolic agent type bots so the methods of machine learning may have some catching up to do in this specific realm of playing nethack but i am optimistic for the future of both methods after seeing the results of the challenge it has been amazing to see a game that i cherish so dearly be used to make new advancements in machine learning and artificial intelligence and i look forward to seeing how teams improve in next year’s challenge ” – tonehack nethack is far from solved first of all the results show that nethack is still a tremendously hard challenge for ai agents whether they are symbolic bots or deep reinforcement learning agents the top median score of 5 000 is several orders of magnitude short of typical human ascensions and while some bots managed to achieve much higher scores in a few limited runs most runs did not descend very deep into the dungeons of nethack and instead stayed within early stages of the game median score is good — but ascensions would be better the challenge highlighted the complex relationship between score and ascension we found many entrants elected to “camp” in the early stages of the dungeon grinding out a high score by killing monsters instead of progressing into the dungeon while this undoubtedly helped the weakest ‘roles’ in the game like tourist or healer it will not lead to winning the game we learnt that score and ascensions are not always well aligned and our objective may be due a rethink in future challenges that said the focus on the median agent performance is still important incentivising the creation of robust general agents but the focus on in game score may be less so symbolic bots can strategize like a human can neural ones nethack benefits ‘strategic’ play — good play often involves executing a series of actions with a well defined expressible sub objective eg “find sokoban” or “apply a unicorn horn to cure poison” symbolic bots found it easy to define ‘strategy’ like subroutines and to decide when to deploy them based on rich human legible representations of the game state this made it easy for participants developing symbolic bots to incorporate their domain knowledge neural agents struggle in this area since hierarchical rl is an open problem in the research field and it is hard for agents to discover ‘strategy’ type patterns of behaviour in environments featuring such a large action space and sparse reward symbolic bots can be know it alls neural agents find it harder the game of nethack is only partially observable only a single dungeon level is ever visible and the many objects and player states are often hidden unless inspected remembering a discovery or incorporating extra knowledge is often key to making a good decision symbolic bots excelled in keeping the full game state in memory and incorporating external knowledge into their strategies they found it easy to transfer domain knowledge to the decision making process in contrast neural agents find it harder to maintain information in memory especially if there is no reward directly associated with it

organizing creating baselines and developing an automated collection pipeline that collects minute by minute market data for cryptocurrencies it updates on kaggle every day and will keep doing so until the competition is over maybe even more the whole project took me a lot of time to develop and is not easy to maintain so please if you find this of value your feedback support is highly appreciated the competition as some of you know there is crypto forecasting competition is running on kaggle g research crypto forecasting in this competition we need to use machine learning for forecasting short term returns of popular cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin ether dogecoin we are provided a dataset of millions of rows of high frequency market data dating back to 2018 which we should use to build our models on once the submission deadline has passed the final score will be calculated over the following 3 months using live crypto data as it is collected auto updating kaggle dataset to make things more interesting i created an auto updating kaggle dataset that collects high frequency market data for multiple cryptocurrencies updates daily on kaggle available for anyone to play with also i also released 20 starter notebooks each demonstrating a different model or method for forecasting future returns this project was meant to be for the currently running crypto forecasting competition by g research however since it is publicly available i assumed many others would like to also have a look mimics real life better than typical datasets this is a unique opportunity to work in a much more real life setup than usual kaggle because the datasets update daily so if you mess up and overfit you see it tomorrow 😂 anyway this is an ongoing project that is also beginner friendly since it is highly documented many more time series finance related notebooks will be released in the future so this can also serve as a first stop when studying time series

all assets of the competition so you can easily build models that utilize it the datasets are split to each asset since they are much heavier than the competition data the datasets have also been labeled as described in the competition overview and had been organized in a way that they are at the exact format of the competition data the goal of this is to provide a dataset that 1 contains the full history for each asset currently the competition data goes back to 2018 this dataset contains data from even earlier 2 auto updating daily due to the high volatility of the cryptocurrency market we should train our models on the most recent data available these datasets have a backend pipeline for collecting formatting and reuploading to kaggle they are scheduled to be updated daily every single day until the end of the competition 3 preprocessed the datasets had been ffilled to overcome any missing values issue that is present in the original competition dataset the datasets binance

rg6vp7,1,best what to plot a user flow ok let me be more specific i m working on an analysis of chatbot data the bot s dialogs contents are represented by ids my company wants to see which routes are more accessed by users i already have that information but the lead data scientist said it would be nice to plot this in a flowchart kind of way he told me to look into sankey diagram but from what i read i don t think it s the best way to do this because it requires information that we don t have here s an example of the id routes x200b most acessed ids 7 43 342 78 92 33 7 123 56 73 23 22 7 89 76 125 48 77 7 89 76 125 48 77 as you can see they are stored as lists the idea would be to plot this in a way it showed the flow of user experience so to sum everything up 1 is there a way to do this using a sankey diagram 2 is there a better way to do this edit btw i m using python

qu1e0q,0,examples of when humans ml model working together outperform either in isolation maybe when interpretability explainability methods used in an ideal world automated explanations of model outputs would make it possible for a human expert and a classifier working together to outperform either working in isolation like an ensemble except instead of having n models that you combine in some way you have 1 model and 1 human who chooses whether to accept the model output or to reject it and go with their own opinion instead “success” is if this setup outperforms both the model and the human acting alone there s some classic literature by paul meehl arguing that when you allow human experts to second guess the outputs of even simple regression based classifers like this having a human expert in the loop doesn t help and generally makes things worse but intuitively it seems like methods for explainability interpretability could help the human know when to defer to the model and when to go with their own opinion for example maybe a skin cancer classifier predicts that some particular lesion is a melanoma but the dermatologist can see from a saliency map that the classifier is not paying attention to the right part of the image and rightly ignores the classifier in that particular instance whereas in a different case where the dermatologist is less certain and the saliency map makes sense they defer to the machine classification is there research that looks at whether the combo of human expert s using ml model with some automated ‘explanation’ of the ml model outputs saliency maps lime whatever outperforms both the human experts and the ml model in isolation i feel like this should be a super common evaluation paradigm in the interpretability literature and perhaps it is and i’m just using the wrong keywords but i’m not finding a lot would be especially interested in cases where the ml model in question is a language model but anything at all in this realm would be helpful edit thanks so much for all the great responses really pleasantly surprised that this sparked so much discussion lots to dig into here i appreciate it
reva1d,0,researchers propose ‘proxyfl’ a novel decentralized federated learning scheme for multi institutional collaborations without sacrificing data privacy tight rules generally govern data sharing in highly regulated industries like finance and healthcare federated learning is a distributed learning system that allows multi institutional collaborations on decentralized data while also protecting the data privacy of each collaborator institutions in these disciplines are unable to aggregate and communicate their data limiting research and model development progress more robust and accurate models would result from sharing information between institutions while maintaining individual data privacy for example in the healthcare industry histopathology has undergone increasing digitization providing a unique opportunity to improve the objectivity and accuracy of diagnostic interpretations through machine learning the preparation fixation and staining techniques utilized at the preparation site among other things cause significant variation in digital photographs of tissue specimens because of this diversity medical data must be integrated across numerous organizations on the other hand medical data centralization involves regulatory constraints as well as workflow and technical challenges such as managing and distributing the data because each histopathology image is often a gigapixel file often one or more gigabytes in size the latter is very important in digital pathology paper github short summary by nitish
r247qp,0,dimensionality reduction on dataset with linear and nonlinear features being used for regression i have a data set with 900 features and 12000 examples i believe that some of the features have a linear relationship with the target variable and others have a nonlinear relationship i’m looking to reduce the input space to save time on training and prevent over fitting by using either feature selection or some sort of feature compression method i believe pca is out of the question because of its assumption of linear relationships amongst features i’m currently looking at using mutual information to do this but i’ve never used this method before what are your thoughts
r78ctn,0,project predicting group behavior based on its members behavior hi everyone i ve been asked to do a small project and i m not completely sure how to tackle it some details i have a dataset that describes the behavior of a few dozen groups each group comprises a number of individuals each group has a score that indicates whether the group is going to become more aggressive or less aggressive this is based on a model that was not created by me i ve been asked to find certain conditions that lead to groups becoming more aggressive for example if half the group s members do a certain activity it means there s a 75 chance the group will become more aggressive there are two options i m considering i can look at statistics of groups that became aggressive say 40 of the members of groups that became aggressive did activity 1 therefore say if 40 of a group does activity 1 the group is likely to become more aggressive i suspect this is what i m expected to do but it confuses causation and correlation the fact that x of a group did something and became aggressive does not mean that groups that do so are likely to become aggressive plus in this case not sure where i will get the probability from i can potentially create a large number of models that proactively try to predict all the groups behavior based on certain conditions if 25 of a group do activity 1 is the group likely to become aggressive if 50 of a group do activity 1 is the group likely to become aggressive if 75 of a group do activity 1 is the group likely to become aggressive if 25 of a group do activity 2 is the group likely to become aggressive if 50 of a group do activity 2 is the group likely to become aggressive if 75 of a group do activity 2 is the group likely to become aggressive and so on however there are too many possible permutations so i don t think this is the right approach so i m unsure how to tackle this i d be very grateful for any thoughts and ideas

qn1erq,0,in theory could we make a code that bridges different music genres i know little to no about coding but i have been playing with vqgan recently and this idea has popped into my head in theory could we write an ai code that gets feed stems that is each instrument track as a separate audio file for two different songs and rebuilds the first song in the style of the second one the code would look for relevant information from the first song such as melodies rhythms structure and maybe even allow the user to feed in the lyrics to the vocals then it would study how these elements are employed in the second song and rebuild the first song using the second song s style this code could rebuild a rock song as a rap song for instance

rl4nqz,0,why is deep learning regarded as black box why do people continue to insist that we don t know how it works or why it does what it does genuinely curious multiple papers i ve read over the past year make the claim that a clear understanding of how dnns work and why they work is yet to be achieved perhaps it is ignorance but i view these claims incredulously a dnn is a giant logistic regressor made up of smaller logistic regressors and it is fitting a curve there is absolutely no magic it is actually very mechanical and borderline mundane so why the proliferation of magical claims professing our ignorance what exactly are all these authors referring to for reference though foundation models are based on standard deep learning and transfer learning their scale results in new emergent capabilities and their effectiveness across so many tasks incentivizes homogenization homogenization provides powerful leverage but demands caution as the defects of the foundation model are inherited by all the adapted models downstream despite the impending widespread deployment of foundation models we currently lack a clear understanding of how they work when they fail and what they are even capable of due to their emergent properties a foundational model here is literally a model such as those in the imagenet zoo used for transfer it s got a vast diversity of feature representations the layers responsible for highly fundamental and therefore transferable features have converged closer to some effervescent global optima it is a very big regressor like what is the mystery here am i just stupid

r8bbsb,1,requesting help for my situation hello i am an undergraduate researcher in my senior year of my computer science and engineering degree the research is focused mainly on computer vision i am currently working with pose estimation image segmentation and object tracking i have been working on this research for about 3 months i have had enough machine learning background to complete my tasks so far but the last 3 months have made me realize i have some gaps in my knowledge about 2 years ago i completed a deep learning course on udacity using pytorch it went through all of the basics for machine learning including a lot of the essential mathematics however i didn t apply what i learned for awhile after the course was over and i m a bit rusty on some of the details additionally i took an autonomous vehicles course at my university which included some basic introductions to computer vision i have also learned a lot over the past 3 months basically i m comfortable doing things like utilizing existing models to solve a specific problem and tuning models hyperparameters structure to boost performance however the mathematics and theory behind what i m doing is fuzzy in my memory and i would really like to rebuild my understanding from the ground up next semester i will be required to do some more advanced work using computer vision techniques to either fine tune an existing animal behavioral analysis network or finish building one that has already been started that will most likely benefit from some additional learning on my part and i would like to use my winter break a little over 3 weeks to do it my question is how can i best utilize this time i know 3 weeks isn t a ton of time but i want to be as efficient as possible with the time i have i know the coursera stanford machine learning course is highly recommended however i am concerned it is too broad introductory for my case as it covers a decent amount of topics i am already comfortable with on the other hand there is a good chunk of information in that course that will be great to fill in the gaps in my knowledge would it be better to do a more advanced course that focuses on computer vision specifically even though some of my fundamentals are missing rusty thanks
rxj5d6,1,looking into the black box of a neural network hey guys i ve recently started working on a research project analyzing a cancer prediction algorithm and was hoping to get y alls advice the algorithm is described in this paper but effectively it uses a cnn on amino acid sequence data from t cell receptors to determine whether they are responding to cancer or not this algorithm performs remarkably well even when public t cell receptors are removed which indicates there s some biochemical difference between cancer and non cancer t cell receptors my responsibility is to analyze the neural net and determine what specific features are heavily weighted in determining the difference between cancer and non cancer t cell receptors hopefully this leads us to the specific biochemical difference i m a bit lost as to where to start with this however how would y all go about looking into this black box any advice would be much appreciated

rqycm4,0,elon musk talking to lex fridman about ai at tesla this is the third interview and there are a few interesting points about how they manage the training and inference of neural nets at tesla some of the points are repeated from other talks like how its all dot products all the way down and repeatedly saying vector space some high level topics the term hydranet multi headed prediction network is not used any more and they have some new type of architecture large focus on the extensive code written in c c to reduce the inference time especially on device this point is mentioned many many times the risk of jitter volatility of inference time and how that can affect the robustness of the overall system retraining the networks based on raw image data instead of processed image data also a small comment that some of the networks they use were built on old hardware and the process of updating new versions of the networks will rely on multiple layers of neural networks instead of some heuristics this implied as they move closer to version 11 that there has been a large redesign distilling giant bags of points or outputs of models that create inferences on multiple outcomes back into something digestible

rbabt8,1,how do you deal with multiples dataframes of the same structure but with different values over the years i m trying to learn more about data science from the too basic courses i took during my past bachelor s degree in computer science until now i have mainly worked with already strucured datasets that i found in various places i always cleaned these datasets with pandas and then applied supervised or semi supervised methods just by manipulating variables names the structure of the dataframes has always been the same for example x200b id gender country age 0 242 m brazil 40 n 815 f canada 38 x200b so i decided to challenge myself by building my own dataset with indicators over the years i found from different free databases after a first batch of headaches with data processing and data cleaning i finally managed to obtain two dataframes with the same structure years as index and names as column headers except for the values which are different one indicator per df here is an example first dataframe with weight name 1 name 2 name name n year 1 138 129 185 130 year year n 174 155 134 220 second dataframe with size name 1 name 2 name name n year 1 49 51 49 55 year year n 62 61 59 64 x200b i don t have the impression that a merge or a concat are possible since i have almost 10 000 individuals over about 50 years with the names of the columns as labels of the individuals themselves where i block is how to obtain same kind of structure that in the first exemple in order to apply some ml methods as usual i have turned the problem around in several directions and i must have made a mistake somewhere but without managing where exactly yet i dare to assume that this problem must be common in data science unless i am wrong how can you perform an analysis with python in this case

rmcp62,0,why does convolution lead to translation equivariance i asked a similiar question before it is my understanding that translational equivariance is one of the main properties that allows convolution to be so powerful at finding patterns in images however i am having trouble finding concrete proofs for how this happens does anyone have any papers that explains why convolution leads to translation equivariance preferably from a linear algebraic perspective secondly does anyone have any papers that explains why translational equivariance allows convolutional neural networks to be so successful at image recognition or explains how this idea of translation equivariance relates to what is happening at each layer thanks
qr6hhb,0,what is the current state of deep learning theory as i assume many people on this subreddit are i m interested in understanding why currently state of the art models work and if we can use the understanding of the underlying princples of these models to create better more powerful ones i mean this in the sense that physics has theory or classical computer science has one in that both develop a mathematical framework to understand and predict their subject there is of course a difference between them as one assumes laws from experiences and onr is more firmly rooted in math but both still use a mathematical approach i sometimes see some papers on this subreddit that look very relevant to this vmatter and while i try to read some of them given my current math education which is somewhere between a practioneer and a ba student i do not believe i can truly understand and therefore judge them so for those of you who are experts in this do we have an accepted predictive theory for deep learning models if not what do we have

r47kvq,0,google research open sources ‘savi’ an object centric architecture that extends the slot attention mechanism to videos multiple distinct things act as compositional building blocks that can be processed independently and recombined in humans’ understanding of the world the foundation for high level cognitive abilities like language causal reasoning arithmetic planning and so on is a compositional model of the universe therefore it’s essential for generalizing in predictable and systematic ways machine learning algorithms with object centric representations have the potential to dramatically improve sampling efficiency resilience generalization to new problems and interpretability unsupervised multi object representation learning is widely used in various applications these algorithms learn to separate and represent objects from the statistical structure of the data alone without the requirement for supervision by using object centric inductive biases despite their promising outcomes these approaches are currently constrained by two major issues 1 they are limited to toy data such as moving 2d sprites or extremely rudimentary 3d scenes and they struggle with more realistic data with complex textures 2 both during training and inference it is not clear how to interact with these models the concept of an object is imprecise and task dependent and these models’ segmentation does not always correspond to the tasks of interest to overcome the problem of unsupervised weakly supervised multi object segmentation and tracking in video data a new google research introduces a sequential extension of slot attention called slot attention for video savi check out the github and paper read the short summary x200b

rn6m8o,0,reinforcement learning with initial policy hi guys happy holidays so i understand the difference between passive rl and active rl is that in passive rl we’re merely learning the values of the states under a policy we feed the agent but in active rl the agent can learn the optimal policy itself what’s the best course of action if we have an initial policy we think is good but we also want to find if there exists a better policy i thought approximate q learning might be suitable where we initialize the q states in our policy with values 0 and all other q states with values 0 and then set a low epsilon to encourage testing that policy first before increasing it over time to see if there are better policies however this seems kind of backwards because usually we’d want to explore more first starting from a “blank slate ” and then exploit is there another way of going about this perhaps combining with some form of passive rl
qx0enm,0,all bias in ml comes from biased data in this post i am referring to bias in a social sense racism sexism … and not to bias in a strictly mathematical sense obviously if we train a model on biased data the trained model will have inherited that bias some people say that this is the main or only way that bias finds it’s way into models however assume that imagenet were a biased benchmark which it probably is and most vision model architectures are developed to do well on imagenet this bias could in some way also be inherent to the resulting architectures not just the learned weights am i wrong here if not what are other ways besides biased data that one should be aware of

qq644r,0,evaluating the effectiveness of text generation i m using gpt3 to generate text based on a q a dataset the data is domain specific based on data scrapped from various internal company sources the challenge i am facing is that the quality of the output is somewhat subjective this makes it hard to improve the model output i ve easily been able to move beyond outputting gibberish to something which works reasonably well however i am not finding it hard to evaluating the effectiveness of minor model changes e g temperature prompt design tweaks to the dataset etc i m considering crowd sourcing input from my colleagues giving them model output with various tweaks and asking them to score the results however this has obvious limitations so i was wondering if there are techniques that people have developed that make it easier to fine tune models where the output has a subjective quality
r6l8nh,1,algorithm selection basic music generation i m looking to generate a very basic sound snippet around 40 50 notes based around a small training set for 5 different genres but i m new to machine learning and am having trouble determining which algorithms i should pursue to implement this i m working in matlab and will use the frequencies of the first 40 chord of a song about 5 10 songs per genre to create a prediction of what the next frequency to play will be based on the previous frequency i e the genre is indie pop putting each song in its most basic form just chords the first frequency of the song is a bflat major chord and the second chord is a g minor chord these chords would be randomly generated knowing that it is part of the indie genre i d want to predict the next 40 chords of the song no rhythms for now just frequencies any algorithm suggestions for this
rs3qef,0,neural pseudo random number generator let s say we have a neural net that generates numbers called g and a neural net predictor called p g s goal is to not let p guess what it generates and p s goal is to approximate g ie g maximizes the difference between g and p s outputs while p minimizes it are there any papers that explores this kind of setup
rhnfm7,0,can neural networks tell whether they have already seen a given example we want our neural network to perform the following task given a training dataset d x 1 x 2 x 3 x n the network should output yes when provided with one example in d or a very similar one and no when provided with one example not similar to any in d examples not in d cannot be provided at training time therefore the network would need to learn to memorize what it has seen and answer no to anything not similar to it to me this looks like an out of distribution detection task but i am not very familiar with the literature so any reference or idea would be really appreciated

qmj7tq,0,local latin hypercube refinement for multi objective design uncertainty optimization many real world systems consist of input features with aleatoric i e irreducible uncertainties in engineering design applications such uncertainties may arise from production tolerances operational conditions as well as other environmental factors thus the distribution of these features can be measured and to some extent modified e g by moving the mean value design uncertainty optimization seeks to find the distribution parameters of input features which optimize metrics such as the failure probability and the variance of key performance indicators besides the expected objective values since these often require uncertainty quantification of black box functions the whole process is computationally quite burdensome in this work we propose using machine learning methods in combination with sequential sampling to reduce the required amount of computation and accelerate the uncertainty optimization task due to the small data setting we limit the investigation to gpr and svr but argue that a more suitable model can exist depending on the problem which could be used within the proposed framework instead

qzsrdw,0,test set just a glorified validation set everything seems to click really well when it comes to training and validation sets but the ideology behind a completely held out test set has never really sat well with me at the most basic level i guess a test set is there so that you don t cheat but at least to me it becomes a lot more nuanced than when you start thinking about how it s used let s say that you ve trained a model that you re proud of and as a final sanity check you test its performance on the test set to see how well the model generalizes on unseen data if the model performs poorly what kind of decision making does this inform do you start over do you tweak the model and try to figure out what s going wrong as soon as you tweak a single thing doesn t the test set instantly become some kind of glorified validation set here are some of my thoughts on the matter and i d be interested in hearing from other people too we know that a test set should not affect the model otherwise it just acts as a validation set thus if we act on a bad test result and change the model the test set becomes a validation set although it is not as involved as a validation set that is used for early stopping or parameter tuning in other words a test set must be useless the moment it is useful it becomes a validation set although to be more precise a test set is not that useless because it probably lowers your expectation about the later performance of the model in production as an example in a kaggle competition the final set is a test set since it does not have any involvement with model training however as soon as the final leaderboard is announced that test set becomes a validation set e g it affects which algorithms we later choose i e those of top competitors in summary it seems that most of the time we are using less involved validation sets to double check more involved validation sets

rl8jrb,0,milvus vector database 2 0 is now cloud scalable objectives of milvus vector database when the idea of the milvus vector database first came to our minds we wanted to build a data infrastructure that could help people accelerate ai adoptions in their organizations milvus in ai ml applications development cycle we have set two crucial objectives for the milvus project to fulfill this mission ease of use ai ml is an emerging area where new technologies keep coming out most developers are not entirely familiar with the fast growing technologies and tools of ai developers have already consumed most of their energies finding training and tuning the models it s hard for them to spend additional efforts handling the large amounts of embedding vectors generated by the models not to mention the manipulation of a large volume of data is always a very challenging task thus we give ease of use a very high priority since it could significantly reduce the development cost low running costs one of the primary hurdles of ai in production is to justify the return of investment we would have more opportunities to put our ai applications into production with lower running costs and it would be conducive to lifting the margin of potential benefits design principles of milvus 2 0 we made a start towards these goals in milvus 1 0 but it s far from enough especially in scalability and availability then we started the development of milvus 2 0 to improve these points the principles we have laid down for this new version include aiming for high scalability and availability building upon mature cloud infrastructure and practice minimum performance compromise in the cloud in other words we want to make the milvus database cluster cloud native the evolution of database clusters the vector database is a new species of database as it handles new types of data vectors but it still shares the same challenges as other databases with some of its own requirements in the rest of this article i will focus on what we have learned from the existing database cluster implementations and the thinking process of how we designed the new milvus group architecture if you are interested in the implementation details of milvus group components please stay on top of the milvus documentation we will continuously publish technical articles in the milvus github repo milvus website and milvus blog the ideal database cluster let s first list the critical capabilities an ideal database cluster should have 1 concurrency and no single point of failure users connected to different group members can simultaneously have read write access to the same piece of data 2 consistency different group members should see the same data 3 scalability we can add or remove group members on the go honestly all of these capabilities are hard to acquire together in the modern implementations of database clusters people have to compromise some of these capabilities people don t expect a perfect database cluster as long as it can fit into the user scenarios however the shared everything cluster was once very close to an ideal database cluster if we want to learn something we should start from here the key considerations of a database cluster the shared everything cluster has a more extended history compared to other modern implementations db2 data sharing group and oracle rac are typical of shared everything clusters many people think shared everything means sharing disks it s far more than that a shared everything cluster only has one kind of database member in the group users could connect to any one of these symmetric members to access any data what is everything that needs to be shared for making this work the sequence of events in the group first the group event sequence is crucial to resolve the potential conflicts caused by the concurrent access from different groups members we usually use the database log record sequence number to represent the event sequence at the same time the log record sequence number is generally generated from the timestamp thus the requirement of group event sequence is equal to the need of a global timer if we could have an atomic clock for the group that would be fabulous yet milvus is an open source software project which means we should rely on commonly available resources to date an atomic clock is still a premium option for large companies we have implemented the time synchronization component in milvus 2 0 database cluster you can find the link in the appendix global locking the database has a locking mechanism to resolve concurrent access conflicts whether optimistic or pessimistic locks similarly we need global locking to resolve simultaneous access conflicts across different group members global locking means different group members have to talk with each other to negotiate the lock requests several vital factors would impact the efficiency of this global lock negotiation process the speed of inter system connections the number of group members who need to participate in the negotiation process the frequency of group conflicts the typical group size is no more than 100 for example db2 dsg is 32 oracle rac is 100 those group members will be placed in one server room connected with optical fiber to minimize transfer latency that s why it is sometimes called a centralized cluster due to the group size limitation people will choose high end servers mainframes or minicomputers which have much more capacity in cpu memory i o channels etc to consist of the shared everything clusters this hardware presumption has dramatically changed in the modern cloud environment nowadays cloud data centers comprise high dense server rooms full of thousands of commodity x86 servers with tcp ip connections if we rely on these x86 servers to build the database cluster the group size should increase to hundreds of even thousands of machines and in some business scenarios we will want these hundreds of x86 machines to spread in different regions thus implementing global locking might not be worth it anymore as the global locking performance will not be good enough in milvus 2 0 we are not going to implement the global locking facility on the one hand there is no update for vector data people should rather delete then insert instead of update so we don t need to worry about the multi writer conflicts on the same piece of data in the milvus group with sharding arrangement meantime we could use mvcc multi version concurrency control a lock avoidance concurrency control method to resolve the reader writer conflicts on the other hand vector data processing consumes a much higher memory footprint than structured data processing people are looking for much higher scalability in vector databases shared in memory data cache we can briefly divide a database engine into two parts the storage engine and the computing engine the storage engine is responsible for two critical tasks write data to permanent storage for durability purposes load data from the permanent storage to the in memory data cache aka buffer pool this is the only place where the computing engine accesses data in the database cluster scenario what if member a has updated the data cached in member b how could member b know its in memory data is expired the classic shared everything cluster has a buffer cross invalidation mechanism to resolve this issue the buffer cross invalidation mechanism will work similarly to global locking if we maintain a strong consistency across the group members as stated before it is not practical in the modern cloud environment so we decided to lower the consistency level in the milvus cloud scalable group to an eventual consistency manner in this way the buffer cross invalidation mechanism in milvus 2 0 can be an asynchronous process shared storage shared storage is probably the first thing people would think about when discussing a database cluster storage options have also significantly changed in recent years of cloud storage evolution the storage attached network san was and still is the storage foundation of the shared everything group but in the cloud environment there is no san the database has to use the local disk attached to the cloud virtual machines using local disk introduces the challenge of data consistency across the group members and we also have to worry about the high availability of the group members then snowflake made a great role model for cloud databases using cloud shared storage s3 storage it inspires milvus 2 0 too as stated before we intend to rely on mature cloud infrastructure but before we could utilize cloud shared storage we have to think about a couple of things first s3 storage is cheap and reliable but it is not designed for instant r w access like database scenarios we need to create the data components which we call data nodes in milvus 2 0 to bridge the local memory disk and s3 storage there are some examples like alluxio juicefs etc we could learn the reason we can not integrate these projects directly is we focus on different data granularity alluxio and juicefs are designed for datasets or posix files while we focus on the data record vector level when the vector data is settled on s3 storage the answer for metadata is easy store them in etcd how about the log data then in the classic implementations the log store is also based on san the log files of one database group member are shared within the database cluster for failure recovery purposes so this was not a problem until we got into the cloud environment in the spanner paper google illustrated how they implemented the globally distributed database group with paxos consensus algorithm you need to program the database cluster as a state machine replication group the redo log is usually the state that will be replicated across the group redo log replication by consensus algorithms is a powerful tool and it has substantial advantages in some business scenarios but for the milvus vector database we don t find enough incentives for creating a state machine replication group as a whole we decided to use the cloud messaging queue platform apache pulsar apache kafka etc as an alternative cloud shared storage for the log store by delegating the log store to the messaging platform we acquire the benefits below the group is more event driven which means many processes can be asynchronous it improves scalability the components are more loosely coupled making it much easier to perform online rolling upgrades it improves availability and operability we will revisit this topic in the later section so far we have wrapped up the crucial considerations of the database cluster before we can jump to the discussion on the milvus 2 0 architecture let me first explain how we manage vectors in milvus data management and performance predictability milvus stores vectors in collections the collection is a logical concept equivalent to a table in sql databases a collection could have multiple physical files to keep vectors a physical file is a segment the segment is a physical concept like a tablespace file in sql databases when the data volume is small we can save everything in a single segment physical file but nowadays we are constantly facing big data when there are multiple segments physical files how should we spread the data in different data partitions although data comes first rather than indexes we have to store data in the way that the index algorithm prefers to make the data access efficiently in most cases a frequently used strategy in sql databases is partition by the range of partitioning key values people usually create a clustered index to enforce the partitioning key overall this is a decent approach for sql databases data is stored in good shape optimized for i o prefetch but there are still defects data skew some of the partitions might have much more data than others the distribution of real world data is not as simple as the numeric range access hotspots more workload might go to some of the data partitions imagine more workload goes to partitions with more data we need to rebalance the data across the partitions when these situations occur this is a dba s tedious daily life the clustered index for vectors we can also create a clustered index for vectors an inverted list index but that is not the same case as sql databases once the index is built in sql databases it s very efficient to access the data through the index with less computation and less i o operations but for vector data there will be far more computation and i o operations even with an index so the defects mentioned before will have a more severe impact on vector database clusters moreover the cost of rebalancing vectors across different segments is very high due to the data volume and computing complexity in milvus we use the strategy of partition by growth when we inject data into a vector collection milvus will append the new vectors to the latest segment in the collection milvus will close the segment once its size is large enough the threshold is configurable and build the index for the closed segment in the meantime a new segment will be created to store the upcoming data this simple strategy is more balanced for vector processing the vector query is a process to search for the most similar candidates in the vector collection it is a typical mapreduce procedure for example we want to search the top 20 similar results from a vector collection with ten segments we can search the top 20 on each one of the segments and then merge the 20 10 results into the final 20 results since each segment has the same amount of vectors and a similar index the processing time on each segment is almost identical it gives us the advantage of performance predictability which is essential when planning the scale of the database clusters new paradigms in milvus 2 0 in milvus 1 0 we implemented a read write splitting sharding group like most sql databases it was a good attempt at scaling the milvus database cluster but the problems are quite obvious too milvus 1 0 sharding cluster in milvus 1 0 the r w node has to take total care of the latest segment including vector appending searching in this unindexed segment building index etc since each collection only has one writer the writer is very busy if the data is continuously streamed into the system the performance of data sharing between the r w node and the reader nodes is also a problem besides we must either rely on nfs not stable or premium cloud storage too expensive for shared data storage these existing problems are hard to tackle in the milvus 1 0 architecture thus we have introduced new paradigms into the milvus 2 0 design to resolve these issues milvus 2 0 cloud scalable vector database actor model there are two models to program concurrent computation systems shared memory that means concurrency control locking and synchronous processing the actor model aka message passing means message driven and asynchronous processing we can also apply these two models in distributed database clusters as stated before most high profile distributed databases use the same method redo log replication by consensus algorithms this is synchronous processing using consensus algorithms to build a distributed shared memory for redo log records different companies and venture capitals have invested billions of bucks in this technology i didn t want to comment on this until we started to work on milvus 2 0 many people regard this technology as the only way to realize distributed database systems this is annoying if i don t say something people might misunderstand that we were reckless in distributed database design in recent years redo log replication by consensus algorithms has been the most overestimated database technology there are two key issues the presumption that redo log replication is better is fragile vendors mislead people s expectations on the capability of consensus algorithms let s say we have two database nodes the source node and the target node in the ever beginning they have the exact copy of the data we have some change operations i u d sql statements on the source node and we want to keep the target node updated what should we do the simplest way is to replay the operations on the target node but this is not the most efficient way thinking about the running cost of an i u d statement we can divide it into the execution preparation and the physical work parts the execution preparation part includes the work of sql parser sql optimizer etc no matter how many data records will be affected it is a fixed cost the cost of the physical work part depends on how many data records will be affected it is a floating cost the idea behind redo log replication is to save the fixed cost on the target node we only replay the redo log the physical work on the target node the cost saving percentage is the reciprocal of the number of redo log records if one operation only affects one record i should see significant savings from redo log replication what if it s 10 000 records then we should worry about the network reliability which one is more reliable send the one operation or the 10 000 redo log records how about one million records redo log replication is super in scenarios like payment systems metadata systems etc in these scenarios each database i u d operation only affects a small number of records 1 or 2 but it s hard to work with i o intensive workloads like batch jobs vendors always claim consensus algorithms could provide strong consistency to the database clusters but people only use consensus algorithms to replicate the redo log records the redo log records are consistent on different nodes but that doesn t mean the data views on other nodes are consistent either we have to merge the redo log records into the actual table records so even with this synchronous processing we can still only get eventual consistency on the data views we should use redo log replication by consensus algorithms in the appropriate places the metadata system etcd and messaging platform e g apache pulsar used in milvus 2 0 have implemented consensus algorithms but as i said before for the milvus vector database we don t find enough incentives for being a state machine replication group as a whole in milvus 2 0 we use the actor model to organize the worker nodes the worker nodes are lonely they only talk to the messaging platform getting commands and sending results it sounds boring the actor model is asynchronous it is suitable for scalability and availability since the worker nodes don t know each other there is no impact on other worker nodes if some of the worker nodes join or are removed separation of availability and durability in milvus 2 0 we do operation replay rather than log replay because in the vector database there is not much difference between operation replay and log replay we don t have the update function nor the insert with select function and it s also much easier to do operation replay with the actor model so multiple worker nodes might execute the same operation from the messaging platform according to their responsibility i mentioned before we decided to use the s3 cloud storage as the shared storage layer of the milvus database cluster the s3 storage is very reliable then is it necessary for different worker nodes to write out the same data to the shared storage thus we designed three roles for the worker nodes the query node maintains an in memory data view according to the assignment the work of the query node includes doing vector search and keeping the in memory data updated but it doesn t need to write anything to the s3 storage it is the most memory sensitive node in the group the data node is responsible for writing the new data to the s3 storage the data node doesn t need to maintain the in memory data view so the hardware configuration of the data node is quite different from the query node the index node builds indexes for the segments closed by the data node when the size of the segments reaches the threshold this is the most cpu intensive work in the group these three types of nodes represent different kinds of workload they can scale independently we call it separation of availability and durability learned from the microsoft socrates cloud database

razsj2,0,why do people “read” as many papers as possible i’ve got a few colleagues who always claim to be reading papers but the way they “read” is so damn superficial as an example i had just finished fully reading comprehending a paper and i won’t lie took me a solid couple days to understand everything fully and reading things multiple times meanwhile in the daily meetings we have i mention the paper and how we should try and use some of their components in our own work and someone says “oh ya i read that in like 15 mins” so we decide to have an impromptu discussion on it and jesus christ i swear the only thing he read was the abstract and maybe glanced at the network architecture i’m sorry this is turning into an rant it just really grates my nerves when people say they read something and in reality all they did was look at the abstract i’m a firm believe that reading comprehending and fully understand 1 single “key” paper from whatever field you’re studying is a much better investment of your time than skimming through 100 regurgitated ideas edit guys just to clarify i do believe in skimming abstracts and looking for interesting papers i go through dozens a day myself you’d be lost otherwise haha i take issue though when someone claims they’ve “read” something when all they’ve done is gone through the abstract and glanced through it
r47k8g,0,smart solution to reduce an impractical number of iterations in a time series model hello folks we have a timeseries based ml solution that helps with anomaly detection and finding the root cause for this anomaly how it currently operates is if i see an anomaly in a metric if the actual is far from prediction we try to examine the associated dimensions and associate the anomaly to its root cause accordingly for example considering covid related deaths across the us if our model senses an anomaly steep rise fall we try to break down the available data by state and see which state is responsible for such a steep change in this example there is only one dimension which is the state so our model in essence iterates over 50 states hence 50 iterations when we try to scale this up to multivariate that involves for example 5 dimensions to the already existing state say we add gender age group income group health rating the number of iterations is going to explode what was earlier 50 is now going to become 50 states 4 genders 10 income groups 12 health ratings 24 000 iterations when such a model has to detect anomalies in say e commerce data where the number of dimensions is going to be larger i hope you see how can t our model scale at least without parallelization how do you guys think can we solve this any suggestion is greatly appreciated thanks

rs31ic,1,what is l2 distance a 2 minute visual guide x200b 🔵 euclidean distance 🔵 🚀 when we talk about distance we generally mean euclidean or l2 distance as this is the one that is commonly taught in school and euclidean geometry has a wide variety of applications 👽 the l2 distance is computed using the pythagorean theorem and the cartesian coordinates of the points in space l2 distance is the p norm when p 2 but of course like all other distances it can be applied to measure the closeness of two objects in higher dimensions as well 🔷 about the squared circle since many shapes and concepts in geometry involve distance the way you define this distance can have an effect on this and its properties when you choose the distance to be defined by l2 distance you get the familiar round circle but when you do that with the l1 distance you get a rotated square as a circle 🤓 l1 and l2 norms are used to perform the regularization of parameters of a model if you have a neural network or a simple linear regression model you can regularize to prevent overfitting lasso and ridge regression use l1 and l2 regularization respectively if you like such content and would like to steer the topics i cover feel free to suggest topics you would like to know more about in the comments

rlvyvl,0,what architectures exist for time series map prediction i ve been given a problem of generating a map of predicted dust clouds imagine you have an n by m grid and you know the amount of dust in each cell you also know how much new dust is being produced in each cell intuitively the amount of dust in a cell at time t 1 will depend on the amount of dust in the nearby cells at time t the amount of dust being produced in nearby cells at time t and other factor such as wind for simplicity lets ignore the win i m curious what architectures exist for this sort of problem my initial idea was to have an n by m by 2 input shape and an n by m by 1 output the input would be the current dust map in the first layer and the map of the newly produced dust in the second layer the output would be the dust map after one time step in this case a convolutional autoencoder seems like the simplest solution this technique is used in this paper very few models for dust exist so i ve been researching weather prediction models as they are very similar to my problem i ve seen techniques that use gans although the discussions on this forum about it seemed to have some doubts about its effectiveness i ve briefly looked at r cnn methods i don t think they would be applicable as they are more for object detection but feel free to tell me otherwise i ve also considered that if my grid is small enough i could probably get away with not using convolutions at all and could just run it as a straight rnn problem but that might require a lot more data to converge as its missing the adjacency context the convolutions provide any ideas are much appreciated

rmrifl,0,multi output generation with sparsely fixed output i am trying to use generative deep learning to synthetically generate certain biological parameters given some experimental constraints i am using gans to do this and i have been successful so far for the next step i want to fix certain parameters in the output vector to some experimentally verified values and then generate the rest of the parameters in the output vector based on this the features in the output vector of the gans are obviously coupled by some complex non linearities so changing or fixing one of them will propagate to the other outputs as well is there some way to do this what i have already tried researched 1 transfer learning on a trained generator with a curated training dataset where the output features i want to fix are already constrained it works the gan learns to fix the values of certain output features but this is because they are already fixed in the training data 2 context encoding in gans i am aware that context encoding and similar tasks have been already showcased where gans are used to fill in missing regions in an image based on the rest of the image but extrapolating this to my case is hard to make a direct comparison my case is analogous to having an image that has only a few pixels that are shown and the rest of the image is masked and need to be inferred i could not find any literature on such sparsely fixed output if anyone is aware of some literature or blog that tackles a similar problem please let me know

rsyiyj,1,shared weights between different implementations hey all i am currently implementing a convolutional neural network in rust goal is to compile to wasm and deploy on the browser so far i have an implementation that matches tensorflow up to almost perfect accuracy we have some very slight errors that are probably unavoidable with floating point computations f e 0 70710677 vs 0 07071068 now the goal is to port a model that already works from python to rust i already have the weights from the trained python model and simply load them into rust the problem is those small numerical differences add up harder and harder each layer while after the first layer the outputs might differ by something like 1e 6 a few layers up we suddenly have completely different values are there any ideas to prevent this or is there no other way than training in rust pretty unfeasible as we would then basically have to write a complete backprop and training procedure – our conv implementations likely aren t fast enough for a nice result x200b greetings

qoqp4w,0,discussion mlops tool for image data management and exploration hi there x200b large part of the current work of our developers is dedicated to manual work on data this is done in several stages of the development 1 in the beginning when we get the annotated data we go over it thousands of images for segmentation tasks we observe the annotated images to validate the annotation correctness and images relevance for our tasks some images may be correctly annotated but not relevant to our task or use case so we remove them 2 we check statistics of the data to validate that the data isn t biased for example that we have enough samples from each class and that the distribution of instances sizes e g number of pixels in the segmentation mask within the classes is reasonable 3 when we have a trained model we go over images for which the model gives poor results and try to find similarities to understand weaknesses of the model and find root causes this often leads to change of the data and repeating stages 1 2 and eventually 3 these are very time consuming tasks and we are looking for mlops tools that will make this work more efficient optimally the tool will also take care of other mlops aspects like experiments orchestration experiment tracking and data versioning we can also combine several tools but using few one tools is preferred open source or proprietary paid product are both possible any recommendations thanks

r4ngnz,0,is the true few shot setting described in recent papers reasonable or am i not understanding the concept properly i ve been coming across a few papers in few shot learning that claim to be under the paradigm of true few shot learning inspired by the paper true few shot learning with language models perez et al 2021 the basic claim is that the current n way k shot setting that s widely used in few shot tasks is unrealistic due to the fact that the models still have access to many data points in other classes not to mention that these models also usually have access to a development set to tune their hyperparameters the authors claim that these assumptions are unrealistic on the grounds that assuming access to other classes data points is unrealistic and that if we have access to a dev set then we might as well use it for training i m writing this post because i m not sure if i agree with those claims or if i m just not understanding the paper properly and would like to seek some other opinions why is it unrealistic to have access to a dev set if that s the case why do we even have a test set as well under the logic presented in the paper if we have a test set then we might as well include that in training too furthermore if we have a test set wouldn t it actually be more realistic to split that to have a dev set as well

r4639a,1,checking understanding of neural networks hi i just wanted to check whether i have actually understood how a neural network works so you first initialise a network with an input layer and some hidden layers and an output layer each with some nodes is that the right word should i use perceptron or neuron instead the input layer takes the weighted sum of the inputs and adds a bias weights and biases are usually random at first this is then run through an activation function usually sigmoid which represents the probability that the neuron is active the input is fed forward through the network in this way and an error is calculated at the end after that backpropagation is used to adjust weights and biases and then the input is fed forward and another error is calculated this way error reduces over time this network can then be tested on test data how accurate is this description also how is this different to a cnn or dnn thank you

r8tdrm,1,a logo detection nn outperforms by almost 2x a logo detection nn which is only one year older what am i missing we have these two nn architectures logo yolo 2020 paper benchmarks osf logo 2021 paper benchmarks both nns were tested on the logodet 3k 1000 dataset but even though the papers are only one year apart the map scores from the new paper are almost double the ones from the older paper take for instance cascade r cnn it has an map of 48 14 on the older paper and 89 1 on the newer paper yes cascade r cnn seems to have different backbones on each paper but can it make such a big difference also resnet 101 has 101 layers while r 50 fpn i assume has 50 layers is it even realistic that in one year you get a backbone architecture with way fewer layers and it s way more performant than the previous one so which model is state of the art in logo detection thank you
r8yq8n,0,how to assert whether the complex high dimensional data have a predictive power or not i am assigned with a binary classification of multi channel time series signal data but the data collection process is expensive so they give me a very small sample of data 15 samples per class and check whether the data is good enough to make a prediction they want me to check the prediction power of the data so they can retune the sensor hoping for more different signal or just give up if the task is too hard and the sensor is not good enough to capture the difference the problem is i don t know how to assert that if it s an rgb image classification task it s easy since we can just look at the image and see the features but this one is complicated and hard to understand the feature i did some simple plot comparison between channel of each class it s still look similar but that s just to my eyes with enough data it may be able to tell the different i imagine doing some kind of eda but for the signal processing to extract some kind of statistics but not sure if i can extract any useful information to be confident that it have a predictive power please suggest me if you have some ideas anyway how do you guys usually dealing with this not limiting to signal but complicated dataset in general is it my job to assert that or should i just tell them that it s not easy to know unless we have enough data which in this case will be very costly if i gonna use deep learning i probably try to do traditional signal feature extraction first like fourier transform and feed the extracted data in simpler model rather than let the model learn the feature itself

qy8gfg,0,paper explained learning rate grafting transferability of optimizer tuning w rant about reviewer 2 the last years in deep learning research have given rise to a plethora of different optimization algorithms such as sgd adagrad adam lars lamb etc which all claim to have their special peculiarities and advantages in general all algorithms modify two major things the implicit learning rate schedule and a correction to the gradient direction this paper introduces grafting which allows to transfer the induced learning rate schedule of one optimizer to another one in that the paper shows that much of the benefits of adaptive methods e g adam are actually due to this schedule and not necessarily to the gradient direction correction grafting allows for more fundamental research into differences and commonalities between optimizers and a derived version of it makes it possible to computes static learning rate corrections for sgd which potentially allows for large savings of gpu memory x200b outline 0 00 rant about reviewer 2 6 25 intro overview 12 25 adaptive optimization methods 20 15 grafting algorithm 26 45 experimental results 31 35 static transfer of learning rate ratios 35 25 conclusion discussion x200b paper openreview old paper arxiv
r1bd7l,1,no data no problem unsupervised learning tsdae and sentence transformers hi all i put together an article and video covering tsdae fine tuning for sentence transformer models basically how we can use plain unstructured text data to fine tune a sentence transformer not quite no data but close from the tsdae paper you actually only need something like 10 100k sentences to fine tune a pretrained transformer for producing pretty good sentence embeddings i was achieving same stsb evaluation with a tsdae train bert as i was getting with my own nli labeled dataset trained bert using softmax loss so pretty cool imo although in reality supervised methods produce better performing models if you have no labeled data unsupervised is the way to go it was really cool learning about this planning to do more on unsupervised sentence transformers in the future let me know what you think

qz3qtv,0,5 considerations for deploying machine learning models in production – what did i miss i wrote a post about considerations for deploying machine learning models in production below are the considerations what did i not consider i know the first consideration seems obvious but i thought it was worth mentioning 1 use your laptop for development as a best practice consider your development environment first most data scientists or ml engineers invariably use their laptops for development testing or debugging code because of simplicity easy to access and install the latest ml libraries practitioners overwhelmingly prefer laptops over clusters for development we are spoiled by ides and syntax highlighted editors for good reason python developers like to customize their environments to match their staging environment with library dependencies using conda or python virtual environments ideally as a best practice if the same code developed on their laptop can run with minimal changes on a staging or production environment on the cluster it immensely improves the end to end developer productivity consider your laptop as a preferred choice of development environment with the possibility of extending or syncing your code to the cluster environment in the cloud consideration number 1 use your laptop for development as a best practice 2 training at scale and tracking model experiments unlike the traditional software development cycle the model development cycle paradigm is different a number of factors influence an ml model’s success in production first the outcome of a model is measured by its metrics such as an acceptable accuracy second achieving an accuracy that satisfies the business goal means experimentation with not only one model or ml library but many models and many ml libraries while tracking each experiment runs metrics parameters artifacts etc as vital as accuracy is so is a developer’s choice of ml libraries to experiment with third accuracy is directly linked to the quality of acquired data bad data results in a bad model data preparation feature extractions feature selection standardized normalized features and data imputations encoding are all imperative steps before the cleansed data lands into a feature store accessible to your model training and testing phase or inference in deployment fourth a choice of programming language that is not only familiar to your data team — data analysts data scientists and ml engineers — but also supported by many ml libraries employed during model experimentation and training phases python seems to be the de facto choice alongside a choice of a programming language is the choice of an ml framework for taming compute intensive ml workloads deep learning distributed training hyperparameter optimization hpo and inference — all at horizontal scale — from your laptop single node multiple cores to multiple nodes with multiple cores and finally the ability to easily deploy models in diverse environments at scale part of web applications inside mobile devices as a web service in the cloud etc consideration number 2 consider using model life cycle development and management platforms like mlflow dvc valohai weights biases or sagemaker studio and ray ray tune ray train formerly ray sgd pytorch and tensorflow for distributed compute intensive and deep learning ml workloads 3 managing machine learning features feature stores are emerging pivotal components in the modern machine learning development cycle as more data scientists and engineers work together to successfully put models in production having a singular store to persist cleaned and featurized data is becoming an increasing necessity as part of the model development cycle feature stores address operational challenges they provide a consistent set of data between training and inference they avoid any data skew or inadvertent data leakage they offer both customized capability of writing feature transformations both on batch and streaming data during the feature extraction process while training and they allow request augmentation with historical data at inference which is common in large fraud and anomaly detection deployed models or recommendation systems aside from challenges and considerations of putting models in production operationalizing ml data is equally important model accuracy depends on good data and feature stores help manage precomputed and cleansed features for your model training and production inference during model serving consideration number 3 consider feature stores as part of your model development process look to feast tecton sagemaker hopsworks and databricks for feature stores 4 deploying serving and inferencing models at scale once the model is trained and tested with confidence that it met the business requirements for model accuracy seven crucial requirements for scalable model serving frameworks to consider are framework agnostic a model serving elected framework should be ml framework agnostic that is it can deploy any common model built with common ml frameworks for example pytorch tensorflow xgboost or scikit learn each with its own algorithms and model architectures business logic model prediction often requires preprocessing post processing or ability to augment request data by connecting to a feature store or any other data store for validation model serving should allow this as part of its inference model replication some models are compute intensive or network bound as such the elected framework can fan out requests over to model replicas load balancing among replicas to support parallel request handling during peak traffic request batching not all models in production are employed for real time serving often models are scored in large batches of requests for example for deep learning models parallelizing these image requests to multiple cores taking advantage of hardware accelerators to expedite batch scoring and utilize hardware resources is worthy of consideration high concurrency and low latency models in production require real time inference with low latency while handling bursts of heavy traffic of requests the consideration is crucial for best user experience to receive millisecond responses on prediction requests model deployment cli and apis a ml engineer responsible for deploying a model should be able to use model server’s deployment apis or command line interfaces cli simply to deploy model artifacts into production this allows model deployment from within an existing ci cd pipeline or workflow patterns of models in production as ml applications are increasingly becoming pervasive in all sectors of industry models trained for these ml applications are complex and composite they range from computer vision to natural language processing to recommendation systems and reinforcement learning that is models don’t exist in isolation nor do they predict results singularly instead they operate jointly and often in four model patterns pipeline ensemble business logic and online learning each pattern has its purpose and merit machine learning engineers adopt two common approaches deploy these patterns of models in production one is to embed models into a web server and the other is to offload to an external service each approach has its own pros and cons with respect to the seven considerations above consideration number 4 look to seldon kfserving or ray serve for all these seven requirements 5 observing and monitoring model in production model monitoring often an overlooked stage as part of model development lifecycle is critical to model’s viability in the post deployment production stage it is often an afterthought at an ml engineer’s peril models have an afterlife of viability that viable life in production needs a constant watchful or sentinel eye in fact monitoring as a phase is simply a continuation of the model serving why consider model monitoring for a number of practical reasons this stage is pivotal let’s briefly discuss them data drifts over time as we mentioned above our quality and accuracy of the model depends on the quality of the data data is complex and never static meaning what the original model was trained with the extracted features may not be as important over time some new features may emerge that need to be taken into account for example seasonal data changes such features drifts in data require retraining and redeploying the model because the distribution of the variables is no longer relevant model concept changes over time many practitioners refer to this as model decay or model staleness when the patterns of trained models no longer hold with the drifting data the model is no longer valid because the relationships of its input features may not necessarily produce the model’s expected prediction hence its accuracy degrades models fail over time models fail for inexplicable reasons a system failure or bad network connection an overloaded system a bad input or corrupted request detecting these failures’ root causes early or its frequency mitigates user bad experience or deters mistrust in the service if the user receives wrong or bogus outcomes systems degrade over load constantly being vigilant of the health of your dedicated model servers or services deployed is just as important as monitoring the health of your data pipelines that transform data or your entire data infrastructure’s key components data stores web servers routers cluster nodes’ system health etc collectively these aforementioned monitoring model concepts are called model observability this step is now an acceptable imperative in mlops best practices monitoring the health of your data and models should never be an afterthought rather it ought to be part and parcel of your model development cycle consideration number 5 for model observability look to evidently ai arize ai arthur ai fiddler ai or whylabs ai thanks to this excellent pytorch reddit post for inspiring the formatting of this post
rwxmw4,0,search engine for time series hi last year i developed a passenger flow forecasting model passenger flows are heavily influenced by lockdown measures and the weather so i wanted to incorporate features relating to that into my model doing so i encountered various frustrations x200b data providers generally focus on a specific domain e g covid weather ecommerce forecasts however can be influenced by data from many domains finding these providers signing up and reading documentation is very time consuming it takes a lot of code just to get the data you want for example to get covid data for my province i first had to call a list endpoint then retrieve the province identifier and then loop over the data endpoint because the maximum range was 2 months i think the core problem is that api’s as the acronym indicates are meant to be interfaced with programmatically but that data scientists end up calling api’s manually before the model runs in production my proposed solution is to build a platform that partners with many data providers indexes their time series and make them searchable with a semantic search each result would be a single time series this search would be usable via a web ui and endpoint screenshot of web ui prototype library i currently have a working prototype with pretty decent search but haven t really validated my assumptions it would be great if you could provide some feedback does it make sense to focus on time series or would a general semantic data search make more sense how do you currently get external data into your model what are your major pain points do you semantic search could speed up the process of acquiring external datasets any other thoughts thanks for your feedback

rcdbiz,1,how to version your machine learning experiments instead of just tracking them distributed versioning vs centralized tracking for ml experiments with dvc and git ml experiments often get split between git for code and experiment tracking tools for meta information because git can t manage or compare all that experiment meta information but it is still better for code the following guide explains how to apply dvc for ml experiment versioning that combines experiment tracking and version control don t just track your ml experiments version them instead of managing these separately keep everything in one place and get the benefits of both like experiments as code track meta information in the repository and version it like code versioned reproducibility save and restore experiment state and track changes to only execute what s new distributed experiments organize locally and choose what to share reusing your existing repo setup experiment versioning treats experiments as code it saves all metrics hyperparameters and artifact information in text files that can be versioned by git which becomes a store for experiment meta information the article above shows how with dvc tool you can push experiments just like git branches giving you flexibility to share experiment you choose

qse2ov,0,why do cnn kernel weights reach high values i ve recently read a bunch of literature about network pruning a common criteria in the field is to select kernels that are to be removed by their l1 magnitude e g 1 2 as the heuristic apparently catches relevant kernels quite well most often the time the cnns are trainied with some form of weight decay this is imho intended to regularize the model and prevent single kernel weights from dominating the entire set of parameters and distribute relevance across multiple channels also it is normal to add batchnorm to the architecture as it stabilizes the training procedure i d argue that 1 the only relevant thing for detecting a pattern is the relative weight between the kernel weights the absolute value does not matter as it will only change the value range cnn kernels are a matrix multiplication and therefore a single scaling factor would do the same as scaling the entire thing 1 as the kernel is followed by a batchnorm the values get automatically scaled and zero meaned before getting scaled and shifted so there is less reason for that when using conv bn relu ordering 2 with any weight penalty this should lead to continuously slowly decreasing values of the kernel weights except in the batchnorms which is way more penalty efficient than a kernel the only reason i could think of is that one will run into some numeric stability issues when one approaches the minimum resolution of the data format i e float16 32 maybe this introduces some sort of noise into the optimization process however as the evidence shows that we get higher weights i have to be wrong and would be happy to get shown where my thought process breaks down 1 comparing rewinding and fine tuning in neural network pruning 2 learning efficient convolutional networks through network slimming

rut9hs,0,is there flow based method which treats input data as different lengths each hello i am searching the researches that different size of data are generated through the flow based network not super resolution task such as continuous mapping i want to generate output as time aligned scalar data for example x200b input noise sampling b x t x c output scalar data b x t c 1 x200b with introducing the variational data augmentation technique in vflow which can output high dimensionality as concatenate noise vector for input and output both for output but there s a problem time dimension t is different for each of all data input how can i treat this problem x200b p s i am very appreciate if i can read the flow based research in nlp task

rkxmt2,0,question about collaboration with data scientists and engineers hello newby to the group here i was wondering if you would mind elaborating on potential demand for ml operations collaboration with data analytics departments and data scientists when i first started in data science the last thing i wanted to do was integrate with apis and perform etl clean and format data into feature sets and manage models i had the most fun calculating interesting statistical reports and building and running simulations i m wondering if with today s data science landscape and tools available folks are still feeling that problem if the problem exists how are folks handling it particularly when building production capabilities from the research and models a little background if you are interested i started developing over 20 years ago because of an interest in data science particularly in finance and economics multi agent systems and machine learning in lisp at the time but my career application and hosting platform engineering and architecture took me away from that objective and i gradually became unhappy with what i was building and managing i made a choice to get back to that passion and i started working on a platform to do the underlying plumbing of managing cloud infrastructure and data integration and processing so i personally could create multi agent simulators and self optimizing recommendation engines but admittedly i am behind on my knowledge about what is really going on in the data science market i created this open source project after my brother died and i would have built it even if nobody else in the world wanted it because it connected my experience with my passion and i really needed something fun to do the reason i am thinking the demand might be there is i have a friend who has a small ai consulting shop and i have been able to work with his team on a us federal government project which allowed me to work with others on model strategy and implementation they did the strategy and initial model implementation in notebooks and rough libraries i translated that into more pluggable and scalable application code and my open source software is handling the production ops and recommendation engines we all got to do what we loved and it seems to be working out well for the client this project took me back to a place i loved in software engineering and i am wondering if this would be a good market to serve because starting in the new year i have to start generating some more revenue and i would prefer to do that in a area i am passionate about

rhmz6m,1,have you ever taken andrew ng s machine learning course in coursera my friend and i are thinking to enroll in this course to start the new year of 2022 until then we saw that it s an 11 week course and now we re thinking if we should start it with a community to increase accountability and completion rate you may wonder why we don t just take a ml cohort based courses well that s a good idea but we don t have a budget it s rare to find good cbcs in a low cost that are well taught by famous instructor like andrew ng from stanford that s why we find this course valuable since it s free but we don t want to study alone or just the two of us either so do you know anyone who s also planning to start a year by learning a new skill in ml it would be nice to start it on january here s the link by the way
qsaonk,0,adversarial loss understanding in total relighting learning to relight portraits for background replacement paper hi i hope to get some help understanding google s total relighting learning to relight portraits for background replacement paper i m stuck on the adversarial loss in 4 1 paper says we add an adversarial loss on the face region to help the network learn to plausibly remove high frequency shading effects from the input image while maintaining image detail we use a least squares discriminator mao et al 2017 disc alb to add a loss between a crop of the face from the ground truth albedo 𝐴crop gt and a matching crop of the face from the predicted albedo 𝐴crop predicted albedo 𝐴crop is the face crop of the output of u net like network no other details provided and i m struggling to understand the setup here since in the paper they re using both ground truth and predicted albedo as the inputs for the loss i can imagine two scenarios 1 use the loss from the original lsgan paper and train the discriminator during the model training which seems counterintuitive to me 2 use l1 or l2 distance between pretrained discriminator s output for ground truth and prediction but that is not really adversarial loss i guess i have no experience with such discriminator usage and therefore can t choose between these two or come up with something else reasonable is there a common way to use gan discriminator for the loss calculation of non gan networks because from the paper it sounds like something that doesn t require deeper explanation

r7wdou,1,i need help understanding the meaning of the loss values of wgan with gradient penalty hey guys i am currently working on training a auxiliary classifier wasserstein gan with gradient penalty i based my implementation off of to which i added the auxiliary classifier functionality i have a model trained off of quite a few epochs of emoji images and i am now trying to filter out bad or vice versa good samples from the set of generated examples i understand that the best way to automatically do this is to utilize the trained discriminator and its loss values to evaluate the fakeness of the images in order to be able to select ones that are able to fool the discriminator now i understand that the discriminator using the wasserstein distance attempts to separate the loss values of fake samples as much as possible from the ones of real samples given that my discriminator output for a randomly chosen set of generated images looks something like the below table i think that the images with maximum or minimum values should be the highest and lowest graded examples 22 96732 12 37780 23 39248 44 45711 14 15668 11 19169 35 99777 9 65943 16 71531 9 35125 25 98240 4 36232 8 58446 24 78805 7 47653 19 14746 28 33695 30 18404 2 67499 8 63077 this should mean that my most fake and most real generated image are the samples with 44 4 or 2 67 but neither of these outliers are particularly more real looking than the other and both look much worse than randomly chosen examples see here how should i interpret these loss values would it make sense to go for a median loss value to get more of the good looking average loss images if so why would it make sense to run a 2 means clustering algorithm on the losses to try and separate realistic and fake samples anyways thanks in advance for your help

qx479l,0,reinforcement learning for traffic light control i have read this very interesting paper about rl for traffic lights reinforcement learning benchmarks for traffic signal control i have already worked with rl for train scheduling but traffic lights are new to me here s what it says in a nutshell many people have developed rl approaches for traffic light tl control many of these people have claimed sota 😅 in this paper they introduce a well defined benchmark using the sumo simulator they show that all things considered recent methods don t perform so well and a simple independent dqn approach is best the flavor of this dqn approach happens to be described in the first author s previous paper this sounds very interesting and wouldn t be the first time that a cleaned up benchmark reveals that a simpler method was the best all along but a few things surprise me independent dqn beats everything else this surprises me as some of the other methods use cooperative approaches i know marl is hard but still in the setting of a complex city i would expect traffic lights that are able to communicate to outperform those that can t although i d expect them to converge more slowly the convergence speed and stability look crazy to me really solving a region scale problem with 21 tls and 4 2k car trips in fewer than 200 episodes of 360 timesteps each that doesn t sound realistic to me in rl land last point i want to bring attention to the amazing intas project this guy made a realistic traffic scenario for ingolstadt germany using actual data from traffic lights public transportation shop opening hours etc that he got from the relevant offices the presentation is worth watching i m curious to hear from more experienced practitioners
ru6fvr,1,trying to get into ml with a specific project and need some help getting started hi i have worked with ml before with simple classifications in the particle physics realm but now i want to go a bit beyond that and have chosen to do something relating to a hobby of mine the hobby is a 5v5 video game where the end goal is to have something where i can feed it what one team is doing and have the model give me what the other team should be doing to have the best chance of winning as a first start and want to have a model classify team1 s chances of winning based on just their trajectories where i train it with their trajectories on the game map and the label if they won the round or not but already here i am not sure how to best build the model because of the trajectory data for each of the 5 players on team1 i have they x y z position for the first 20 seconds of the game but i also dont want the model to care about which players causes which trajectory so the model should treat player 1 trajectory1 player2 trajectory 2 the same as player1 traj 2 player2 trayj 1 it would be great if someone could point me to ressources that allow me to understand how exactly i should build the model for this first step

qs5igm,0,how do i lower my standards for code quality to match my research team i recently joined a lab working on research in robotics reinforcement learning as a research intern i graduated college recently all my previous work experience is ml engineering but not active research rather implementing things people have already done i ve been in the lab a few months now and it s become clear to me that the standards for code in research are a lot lower than i expected i am the only one on my team pushing for things like ci pipelines refactoring documentation regression tests etc and when i do raise such concerns the usual response is that such things are not worth spending time on my supervisor once told me that the job of a researcher is not to write good code it s to find a correct problem formulation describe it correctly and then pass it to a software engineer whose job it is to create the high quality implementation they emphasised the importance of rapid iteration of the idea rather than going slowly because they re concerned about getting scooped in our current project this is true to some extent because we are a small and resource limited group whose experiments can take hours to run working in a popular field quadruped legged locomotion i struggle a lot with this mindset i hate looking at the crappy code written by myself and by my teammates and i hate debugging it trying to understand it a lot of my time is wasted on things like checking which experimental configuration a model was trained from because we don t have automated logging of that aesthetically i also just dislike it i have high personal standards of code quality uncle bob s clean code anyone which i feel like i m constantly breaking when i have to write code for work i m looking for advice on how i can learn to tolerate this better or other similar resolutions to the problem thanks in advance edit thank you all for the kind replies so far i have received many more responses than i was ever expecting to get it s going to be difficult to reply to each one but i will do my best to read all of them and consider i will respond here to some general points i ve seen made repeatedly 1 i m not arrogant enough to think that i know everything about research and coding after 3 months in a lab and as many have rightly pointed out there s no need for research code to live up to the standards of long term production code i do recognize that in this case the problem likely lies mostly with me hence the title of how do i lower my standards and the question of how do i learn to tolerate something i m not comfortable with seeing how popular this post is i m sure this struggle resonates with many others as well as a result i hope for there to be less cynicism about my motives the discussion so far has been largely productive and on topic i appreciate very much it staying that way 2 to give some additional context i am working right now as part of a group i have a main project which i work on with 1 other person also a recent graduate my supervisor actually doesn t look at the code we write at all and as far as i can tell does not care much about code they seem to implicitly trust that we are able to correctly implement things according to the description which i believe is true for both of us at our weekly meetings we present our progress in the form of videos graphs slides this means that i and my teammate are solely responsible for maintaining the quality of code in our current project and as mentioned we have philosophical disagreements about how much code quality matters i know i am not necessarily right 3 the project i am working on is very much not a one off experiment our main codebase is inherited from somebody else who is no longer in the lab which was itself an iteration on some open source implementation we are iterating various elements of the robot s sensor setup in addition to the reinforcement learning algorithm and training curriculum with well known off the shelf envs like those in mujoco i d be pretty happy accepting that it was working as intended with code i write myself or code written by other people which is not tested it s a lot harder to have that confidence 4 as some have correctly pointed out using a standard logging tool like w b would be an easy fix to the time spent on resolving experimental configurations that issue in particular could be resolved easily by setting up the appropriate pipelines and would likely be a net plus to my team more generally i could benefit from critically examining the practices i am used to and seeing which have concrete benefits in my current workplace and then propose those to the team 5 i am a strong proponent of unit tests unit tests save my butt from making simple mistakes it s already incredibly difficult to figure out why experiments fail sometimes i can at least eliminate some of the possible causes by unit testing code where easy and appropriate also when i do fix a bug i write a unit test to enforce the fix and then i can mostly forget about it that mental real estate can go to things that can t be automated as easily 6 similarly i am a big fan of simple ci pipelines like github actions perhaps the term ci comes with a lot of associated bells and whistles which are rightfully not used in research code but to me ci is simply a way to automate the manual running of unit tests with a bit of know how github ci workflows are easy to set up from a cookiecutter template and they save a lot of time as well as mental worry i like to include linters as well but it s not necessary to the core functionality

qmq7hb,0,is there any way for gan to generate arbitrary length of time series signal hello i m working on using gan to generate some signals as i have viewed some related works i found that most of them merely sample a latent vector from some distribution with fixed size e g a latent vector of dim 64 and after some upsampling operation they will get signals in a fixed window size e g a signal of 4s 256hz 1024 points i want to get rid of the annoying limit of fixed window size and be able to generate continuous signal with arbitrary length i tried to code by myself i have designed a gan framework in which the generator takes an input of an arbitrary length of vector and outputs a signal in same length as the input the upsampling process is thrown away here so the generator merely do some modification on the input signal instead of upsampling on it as for discriminator i use global average pooling in replace of the linear layers however my code failed to work so i think maybe i need some new ideas i come to you guys for help do you know any paper that might be helpful for me or do you have any good idea thanks

rwcikx,0,predicting future labels where the future values of only some features are known rnns time series i ve done a fair bit of work with rnns and time series data but i now realize there may be a fundamental gap in my knowledge i was reading through this and it raised some questions about the different kinds of time forecasting problems so this is my summary of how it all works please correct me if i’m wrong scenario 1 you want to predict the value of some stocks into the future let’s say you have k stocks and n days of data you don’t have features labels stocks rather the input is each stocks’ current and previous values and the output is each stocks’ future values your two main options are the ‘auto regressive’ approach where you predict the values one step at a time and feed them back in or ‘single shot’ approach where you predict all values a fixed amount of time steps into the future at the same time this all seems pretty standard and is a well understood problem scenario 2 you have 3 time series features a b c and one label y you know that y is dependent on a b and c you goal is to predict the future values of y my understanding is you can’t use the auto regressive approach because you aren’t predicting a b or c only y but for the single shot approach your input would have shape 4 w and your output would have shape 1 p where w is the number of warmup timesteps and p is the number of timesteps you want to predict y’s value now what if you know the future values of a b and c p timesteps into the future this extra information would obviously help the prediction essentially you could allow your model to peak into the future but only for a b c however complications arise because you can’t pass an input with shape 4 w p because you don’t know the future values of y that’s why we are trying to predict them i’ve not been able to find any papers or information on this type of problem most likely because i don’t know the name of this type of problem but i’ve had a couple of thoughts have the future values of features with known future values as separate features so you would have an input shape of 7 w rather than 4 w since you know the future values of all 3 features some sort of recursive approach where you first come up with some arbitrary prediction of y p time steps into the future then when training you would pass an input of shape 4 w p the past and future values of a b c and the past and predicted values of y and an output of shape of 1 p your loss would be the distance difference between your predicted future y values and the actual future y values you then replace the arbitrarily generated future y values with the ones you just generated and repeat the process not 100 sure if this would work though i’d have to suss out the details scenario 3 similar to the previous scenario but instead of knowing the future values for a b and c you only know the future values for a for example let y be the temperature and a b c be rainfall humidity and cloud cover respectively let’s say you use meteorological rainfall predictions as your know values into the future for a you would ‘know’ some future feature information but not all obviously there are some issues about using another prediction as a future value of a feature but let’s leave that aside for now i’m curious as to what work has been done in this area my intuition says that treating a b c and y as all inputs when you know y is dependent on a b c adds an extra layer of context that would be good to incorporate into this problem

rmaqvu,1,is a bootcamp the best way to learn the ml talk hello i searched and did not find this scenario so was hoping to canvass some views or experiences i already have 2 years of decent fortune 50 multiple deployed projects paid professional ml under my belt not because i sought it out but because i ve been the go to guy for other oddball problems and got chucked into it as it turns out i like ml data and trying to make models predictive i ve been quite lucky to have oceans of data to play in and relatively easy softball problems to try to solve but i am self taught google taught udemy taught at the moment i have major gaps in my knowledge and i know it i know it every time i talk to other ml teams and they throw the 5 dollar words around i m about to be handed a vp of data science role and will be expected to talk the talk about ml far more than i do now potentially to far more talented folks than i this is very much a peter principle situation and i d like to stay ahead of it rather than become an incompetent potato with pointy hair i have been considering a boot camp to level up my ability to formally discuss ml concepts implementation isn t the primary goal but i do love tinkering with this stuff and would benefit from some new hands on techniques also mainly though i need to learn the lingo as others talk it and i need a broad and shallow set of talk rather than a specialization is a bootcamp a good path for this i am in the sf bay area there are dozens of them or is there some better path i should take pausing to sit a degree program won t match my time load appreciate any thoughts on the matter

rchvfb,1,what s the point of hardswish a while ago swish got some attention as it outperformed relu in quite some tasks as far as i understood it it s main benefits are that it keeps the nice properties of relu while being differentiable everywhere and the fact that it s a bit like leaky relu for negative values so what i took away from that is that it s a fully differentiable leaky relu i have been using it here and there and it always worked great it wasn t implemented in pytorch so i always defined it myself easy enough today i found out that torch 1 10 has hardswish which has very similar values to swish but is a composition of 3 functions and is much faster to calculate but as far as i understand it it isn t continuous in the points where it switches from one functions to another taking away one of the big benefits that swish had so we basically give up a fully differential function to save some compute my questions are am i understanding all of the above correctly or are there some errors or misconceptions in my thinking and as in the title is it worth it why and when use hardswish over swish does that bit of more compute actually make a difference
ru86ji,1,time series classification hi everyone i like to take pictures of freight trains and in my area the railroad broadcasts some simple data over unencrypted radio that can show some very basic info about what s going on you don t get the exact position of a train just confirmation that there is a train on a certain piece of track which can be 30ft or 30 miles long and some info about what the track signals are showing long story short i am able to collect this data and i have written programs to identify when a train passed a given part of the track below is an image of this data plotted over distance and time i have manually highlighted what i would like to be able to do with ml which is to classify a given train detection at a location as belonging to a given train trains moving up and to the right are eastbound and trains moving down to the right are westbound trains almost exclusively make their journey all the way from one end to the other it is very common that an eastbound will stop at a siding to let one or more westbounds pass fairly rarely a train will start out one direction turn around and come back the other way complication some radio data is missed depending on various conditions so i can t guarantee that i will pick up every train at every control point but i can pick up enough data to fill in the gaps at least with my own brain i am a half software half electrical engineer and i have taken a couple beginner courses on ml but i m not really sure what type of classifier i should use for this or how i should organize the data i m also not 100 sure that this is a task for ml but it seems natural that it would be especially considering that sometimes missing data has to be inferred i would be very appreciative if you all would be willing to help me out screenshot 20220102 062841 2 png
rgmdwn,1,questioning whether or not i should use a bag of words in my portfolio project i am at odds with whether or not i should use text as a feature in my classification project the problem isn t inherently an nlp one like sentiment analysis but more like a traditional classification problem that uses census and urban data neighbourhood profiles to make predictions on neighbourhoods that being said i have a text column in my dataframe that i can t help but think would make for a good feature if converted into a bag of words i m not versed in nlp but a bag of words with pca makes sense to me i am worried that this might complicate things though and send me down some unnecessary rabbit holes trying to learn about nlp when i might be able to make due without it

r53277,0,cost of distributed deep learning on aws hi everyone i am trying to learn some distributed deep learning techniques such as parameter servers and ring all reduce i found this paper by uber where they describe their implementation of ring all reduce while the implementation looks fairy straight forward i am unsure about the costs the problem is that i don t have access to multiple gpus so i thought i would use aws ec2 since i have never used it before i have used gcp a fair amount but not for distributed deep learning i was hoping someone here could shine some light on the costs of using say 2 gpus my initial idea was to train a cnn using imagenet 1k so i would use s3 and ec2 with two basic gpus as my goal is simply to see how much faster i can reach convergence rather than achieving state of the art times would this be too expensive for a personal project i d rather not spend over 200 gbp

rd2l00,0,1st ever method to perform gpu quantization on most 🤗 hf transformer models 2x faster inference quantization is a technique to significantly accelerate inference by replacing high precision tensors by lower precision representation in a way where accuracy is kept intact or close to it’s quite common in cpu inference a lot less on gpu even if the performance boost is significant end to end method we also added many other benchmarks the library repo apache 2 licence to give you an idea of the latency speed up x200b roberta base classification mnli latency benchmark batch 32 seq len 256 afaik 3 methods of gpu quantization exist for the 2018 vanilla bert architecture 2 from nvidia and 1 from microsoft but none exist for any other architecture roberta electra distillbert deberta etc limiting the benefit of gpu quantization to old models we hope that this project will help generalisation of quantization in nlp and ease nlp big models deployment it’s a big deal as quantization is rarely used on gpu unlike cpu because it requires some nvidia tools not well known from most ml practitioners like tensorrt in the lib we have wrapped those tools so they are transparent to the final user the result is a model that is always several times faster than vanilla pytorch on gpu on any batch size seq length for any transformer flavour small base large xx large etc this work is based on a very recent model qdqbert 2018 vanilla bert which supports quantization added by nvidia to the hugging face transformer library a few weeks ago next to the generic method we have developed we have also implemented in the lib a new model as a proof of concept qdqroberta and no roberta is not identical to bert of course the idea is to extend the process to all transformer architectures there are not that many both approaches offer different trade offs in generalisation and accuracy details in the notebook there are many things which are still to be experimented for instance for qdqroberta and other future qdq models is roberta source code almost trivial modification a good idea should we just patch onnx files like microsoft does or build from scratch the graph directly in tensorrt like nvidia does or leverage the new pytorch fx interface all approaches should in theory lead to the same result accuracy speed but offer different ease of use final user vs ease of maintainability library maintainer trade offs gpu quantization is not very discussed known in nlp so please don’t hesitate to comment ask questions below so we can improve the tuto and democratize gpu quantization

rd6vlv,1,best way for unet to generate masks for different image sizes i am dealing with a dataset that has different size images and so i also have to predict masks of different sizes i would like to have an automatic way of dealing with it that doesn t distort the prediction now i downscale all images to the smallest resolution which appears the most in the dataset the problem is that during backtransformation to bigger resolutions the mask itself gets distorted because there are bigger images and also the bigger ones are mostly not squared the problem now is that my model uses the keras input layer which doesn t allow dynamic inputs i think also the same for the output i hope that anyone can help me
rs65ei,0,adapting class activation maps for object detection and semantic segmentation hi r machinelearning is a project that has a comprehensive collection of pixel attribution methods for pytorch like the package name grad cam that was the original algorithm implemented class activation maps can help diagnose properties about the model predictions like where does the model see a cat in the image after many requests i added support for object detection and semantic segmentation and wanted to share this with you here you can find detailed notebook tutorials about this a tutorial on using class activation maps for object detection a tutorial on using class activation maps for semantic segmentation x200b computing the cam for object detection computing the cam for semantic segmentation the problem class activation maps are usually researched and applied for classification models a repeating request in this repository and also in some object detection projects was to add support for grad cam for object detection one challenge with this is that object detection frameworks typically don t output tensors you can back propagate through to compute gradients they typically output dictionaries with bounding boxes labels etc after a lot of processing and don t expose any way to compute gradients with respect to those detections if you want to compute cams for them you typically have to dive into the code of these object detection packages and create solutions that work only with them there was no generic tool that just works and can be adapted to new object detection models the solution gradient free methods some class activation map methods don t depend on computing the gradients examples of these eigencam computes pca on the activations and returns the first principle component it s very fast since it requires a single forward pass but it doesn t have good enough class discrimination in case you might have several different objects in the same bounding box ablationcam ablates individual activations and measures how the output score drops this is a sota method with class discrimination but it s much slower since it requires many forward passes for doing the ablations object detection networks are already heavy and ablating these activations makes it slower in practice many of the activations don t contain useful information at all and if we can identify those we can just skip ablating them i tried coming up a heuristic that computes a binary mask for where the objects might be based on comparing eigencam with a low threshold and then scoring the activations according to how much of their pixels values fall inside the mask then we can control the ratio of activations we actually want to ablate where a lower ratio makes it faster this seems to give good results with dramatic run time reductions we can use these methods applied on the activations from the feature pyramid network in object detection networks to adapt them for object detection custom cam target functions for object detection segmentation a cam is computed to target some property about the image like what parts of the image is important for the dog category we can adapt this for object detection by targeting properties like what parts of the image are important to get a high iou with the original bounding box detections and score high on the same categories you can similarly adapt this for segmentation by asking questions like what pixels in the image are important for predicting the car pixels x200b i hope you find this useful and that this will be a good starting point towards applying cam methods more in practice and in production for monitoring and diagnostics of vision models
quvv7h,0,a deep generative model enables automated structure elucidation of novel psychoactive substances over the past decade the illicit drug market has been reshaped by the proliferation of clandestinely produced designer drugs these agents referred to as new psychoactive substances npss are designed to mimic the physiological actions of better known drugs of abuse while skirting drug control laws the public health burden of nps abuse obliges toxicological police and customs laboratories to screen for them in law enforcement seizures and biological samples however the identification of emerging npss is challenging due to the chemical diversity of these substances and the fleeting nature of their appearance on the illicit market here we present darknps a deep learning enabled approach to automatically elucidate the structures of unidentified designer drugs using only mass spectrometric data our method employs a deep generative model to learn a statistical probability distribution over unobserved structures which we term the structural prior we show that the structural prior allows darknps to elucidate the exact chemical structure of an unidentified nps with an accuracy of 51 and a top 10 accuracy of 86 our generative approach has the potential to enable de novo structure elucidation for other types of small molecules that are routinely analyzed by mass spectrometry check out our new paper on automatic structure elucidation of new “legal highs” using artificial intelligence and mass spectrometry published at arxiv

r88p0z,0,k means producing very different centroids even after initialization with canopies doing some big data coursework for my ds masters and i am pretty confused by what i m seeing i m running k means clustering on mahout and understand you can generally get different final centroids in k means because it initializes them randomly but i ve initialized clusters using canopy clustering and even after that am seeing wide variance in the final density values here s one example x200b run inter cluster density intra cluster density 1 0 430836339 0 590516787 2 0 618821774170647 0 581433137 3 0 4960634 0 567159394 i ve run this for different k values distance metrics and max iteration values the behavior is similar this is problematic because the purpose of this project is to compare performance across different parameter values with such divergent results within the same parameter set i m forced to run each set of parameters multiple times and take an average which is drastically increasing processing time and computation cost is this expected behavior did i misunderstand something

rvw0rv,0,launching dagshub 2 0 – git integrated data labeling and smart ml discussions tl dr – dagshub is integrated with label studio and you can now open datasets from git and dvc remotes label them and commit labels back without doing any devops you can also comment on labels bounding boxes or any file check out the example project or try out the tutorial comparing annotations hi r ml i m one of the creators of dagshub we help ml practitioners create a central repository for their projects where they can leverage open source tools to version datasets and models track experiments and starting today – label data and comment on anything like github for machine learning you probably heard that before but we mean it our vision is that anyone could jump into an open source data science project and contribute code data labeling models experiments via pull request just like you would with an open source software project we take awesome popular open source tools and connect them to the place you build data science projects lowering the barrier by doing the devops work for you and creating a coherent workflow that makes sense for production oriented teams and our open source community how does it work 1 version your code with git notebooks also work 2 version your data models and pipeline with dvc 3 git push to your dagshub repo 4 dvc push to your free dvc compatible dagshub storage or to your preferred cloud storage which we support 5 you get a zero config access controlled mlflow api endpoint to log experiments we saw that labeling was a big challenge for many community projects as well as teams in the industry we spoke with we wanted to make our community’s life a bit simpler and since many of the challenges were around integrating labeling into the rest of the ml lifecycle that’s exactly what we built with dagshub annotations and the label studio integration the main additions are 1 zero setup labeling – we did all the work so after you push data to dagshub just click a button to fire up a labeling instance 2 sync data from your git dvc remote – after it’s up you can select what data you want to label and it will be waiting in your workspace for you this is something we know many of you have wanted for a while 3 commit back to git – when you’re done with a version of labels we created a “commit” button that just adds the annotations to git making it easy to pull them for model training or any other need you have while preserving the project history 4 diff and discuss annotations – you can see annotations on the data itself check out the example project below and have discussions on them in a way that preserves context even comment on bounding boxes on images committing annotations back to git we created an example project that you can play with to see how it actually looks and of course i d love to hear your thoughts and feedback and answer any questions you might have thank you if you want to read more about the launch check out the launch blog
royf9n,1,bit confused for grocery purchase recommendation approach so i got an assignment to make a grocery purchase recommendation system to maximize sales by recommending items that were popular sellers with those already in cart after a bit research i found that my problem lies in market basket analysis and apriori algorithm was the top recommendation but after reading this paper by amazon about item item collaborative filtering it occurred to me that apriori approach would not be able to suggest items item pairings which are not above its support level i can t keep the support too low as it would then go against apriori s key goal of keeping search terms less to process faster so should i go with a approach which makes a list for each item and its popular pairings to ensure that my code will at least recommend a related sale of the item to the customer or is there a faster and more time and space efficient implementation for the same problem any insight related would be appreciated

rboh2r,0,are transformers overhyped i ve been wondering about this for a pretty long time since i ve never seen anybody say anything bad about transformers while to me they seemed pretty flawed from the moment i ve read the paper i m in no way an ml expert i m only an aspiring phd student who s not even specializing in nlp so if i m any way wrong i d really like to hear it tl dr i believe that transformers are in the long term a pretty small contribution to the world of nlp and may even be damaging due to shifting the focus of the research community in the wrong direction why they don t address the long term dependency problem before transformers nlp used to be dominated by rnns and specifically the encoder decoder architecture in the case of translation the encoder would encode the input sentence in a fixed length vector and the decoder would then decode this vector into an output translated sentence now transformers also use encoder decoder architecture but there is one big difference for rnns encoding and decoding actually happens at every step of the way words i know it s tokens but i ll call them words are inserted sequentially into the rnn for every single word the encoder rnn had to look at the current encoding vector and the input word and then choose how to update the encoding vector in a meaningful way the problem with this approach which i ll call long term dependency arises when the rnn has to look at a very long sequence of words humans can easily distill the information that they ve read and remember only the important bits for example the name of a character that was mentioned 5 pages ago but rnn models had trouble encoding what happened 5 sentences ago the research community starts solving this problem with the original attention paper but then transformers come out so out comes the transformer and starts dominating the nlp world what does the transformer do it is a huge model that when encoding simply takes 512 input words or some other arbitrary number and looks at all of them simultaneously and it works wonders look the transformer can remember what happened 5 sentences ago because the previous 5 sentences combined have less than 512 words hooray can it remember what happened 10 sentences ago though uh well no can we improve it in some way to solve the long term dependency problem well we can be smart about which sentences we feed into it but that means we still have to distill information from a large body of text so we re back at the beginning it s obvious that we have to solve the long term dependency problem if we ever hope to achieve human like nlp models and to me it seems that transformers do nothing to solve this problem so why are they dominating the field of nlp research maybe the optimal solution will include a combination of both the transformer and some other model for information distillation but if we still need to solve the long term dependency problem why are throwing out rnns so quickly

qkert8,0,reusing parts of an open source code for a potential publication and a new open source code i am currently developing a new method that builds up upon an existing work in the literature in order to address the limitations and provide reasonable improvements to what has already been done earlier i reached out to the authors for possible academic collaboration but i have not received a reply from them their work has already been published as a conference paper two years ago and their code is available on github is regularly maintained and has also been deployed as pypi package that can be installed using pip my question is clearly about how to use certain parts of their work without plaigarising or breaking any copyright agreements to what extent is it acceptable to rely on other people s work for producing a new method especially when it is open source since the method i am working on is largely inspired from the existing method it seems that i am currently on track to adopt around 30 of their code and follow their general code structure and oop layout

rlfkvk,1,what is overfitting a 2 minute visual guide x200b 🔵 overfitting 🔵 🧐 overfitting is a common phenomenon the machine learning community tries to avoid like the plague this is because when a model overfits it performs extremely well on the training data that it is provided but performs poorly and fails to generalize on unseen data 💾 you can imagine overfitting with an analogy when one assumes that the questions in the exercise session of a lecture are exactly what will be asked in the exam and end up memorizing them during the exam they realize that this rote learning would not be of any help in answering unseen questions 😮 overfitting can be avoided in many ways 5 common ways to do so is by 1 regularization of the model parameters using l1 or l2 norm for example see previous posts for more details 2 gathering more training data to let the model cut through the noise 3 early stopping by monitoring the training and validation error curves 4 reducing the number of features by selecting better features and 5 by performing data augmentation this is the first post and hopefully the first of many to come i have been studying and practicing machine learning and computer vision for 7 years as time has passed i have realized more and more the power of data driven decision making seeing firsthand what ml is capable of i have personally felt that it can be a great inter disciplinary tool to automate workflows i will bring up different topics of ml in the form of short notes which can be of interest to existing practitioners and fresh enthusiasts alike the posts will cover topics like statistics linear algebra probability data representation modeling computer vision among other things i want this to be an incremental journey starting from the basics and building up to more complex ideas if you like such content and would like to steer the topics i cover feel free to suggest topics you would like to know more about in the comments

rjy067,0,anyone got a hypothesis on why icing on the cake method improves accuracy from my understanding the icing on the cake paper claims higher accuracy by saving the feature maps generated by convolution layers before the classifier layer during training and using them to retrain just the classifier fully connected layers again the authors comment they have no idea why i hypothesize that assuming the classifier training feature maps are given the same order as original training because the feature maps from early in training are very poor cnn not trained and bad at extracting features they actually act as a regularization method for the classifier then the much better feature maps from the end of original training re converges the classifier to a slightly different point in the loss landscape this seems to be similar to layer wise regularization through noise injection perhaps what are your guys thoughts

r06rs4,0,what are some strategies to deal with label sparsity when training a protein function prediction model the protein function prediction task requires you to take a sequence of amino acids think words in a sentence but if there are only 20 words and output the functions that protein can take there are around 30 thousand labels for protein function and these labels are not mutually exclusive so protein function prediction is essentially a huge binary prediction multitask now the catch is some labels are very common and others are very rare and overall a protein is only labeled with a small number of labels out of the 30 thousand labels that biologists came up with in total so if you represent each protein s functions as a binary vector where each 1 entry represents a function it carries then all vectors will be extremely sparse and the majority of labels will only have a few positive examples in the training set which leads to extreme label imbalance what are some strategies i can use to deal with these problems

qpw3br,0,recursive ml strategies i m looking for ideas on how to use recursive ml strategies possibly utilizing multiple individual models where one model uses the output of another model to make more accurate predictions for example i use two sklearn randomforestclassifier models to provide a simple signal about the direction of the stock market the first takes n inputs and outputs a prediction the second takes the original n inputs plus the output of the first to make a new prediction it doesn t provide earth shattering results but it appears to be slightly better than only using the one model random forests also provide the ability to use out of bag samples which could also be used i m just curious if there any established methods papers i should look at etc that discuss meta or recursive strategies to get the most out of ml models

rgosh5,0,the future of artificial intelligence is self organizing and self assembling blog post by sebastian risi excerpt this is the first post in a series i plan to write on the work from our group and others that combines ideas from deep learning with ideas from self organization and collective systems in this first post we’ll look at some of the developed approaches and the domains they have been applied to ranging from growing soft robots and minecraft machines to self assembling modular robots and creating more resilient and adaptive reinforcement learning agents the merger of these ideas could ultimately allow our ai systems to escape their current limitations such as being brittle rigid and not being able to deal with novel situations however the combination of these methods also poses new challenges and requires novel ways of training to work as efficiently as possible one of the most fascinating aspects of nature is that groups with millions or even trillions of elements can self assemble into complex forms based only on local interactions and display what is called a collective type of intelligence for example ants can join to create bridges or rafts to navigate difficult terrain termites can build nests several meters high without an externally imposed plan and thousands of bees work together as an integrated whole to make accurate decisions on when to search for food or a new nest surprisingly achieving these incredible abilities is a result of following relatively simple behavioral rules and through a process of self organization which camazine et al 2001 define as “as a process in which pattern at the global level of a system emerges solely from numerous interactions among the lower level components of the system moreover the rules specifying interactions among the system’s components are executed using only local information without reference to the global pattern in short pattern is an emergent property of the system rather than being imposed on the system by an external ordering influence “ self organizing systems are made out of many components that are highly interconnected the absence of any centralized control allows them to quickly adjust to new stimuli and changing environmental conditions additionally because these collective intelligence systems are made of many simpler individuals they have in built redundancy with a high degree of resilience and robustness individuals in this collective system can fail without the overall system breaking down multicellular organisms learned to exploit self organizational principles to self assemble starting from a single egg cell and only through the process of local cell interaction during embryonic development similar to the robustness of swarms of organisms the self organization of cell populations is remarkably robust to perturbations in some animals this goes as far as being able to regenerate complete body parts such as a salamander’s tail this type of self repair is a common feature of self organizing systems and interestingly does not involve any additional processes “the same self organization process that built the initial pattern can operate to repair the pattern ” — camazine et al 2001 rest of the blog

the existential threat that many of us are worried about but it s plausible that some of the issues that will be found in such future systems might already be present in gpt 3 and it s plausible to think solving those issues in gpt 3 will help us solve equivalent issues in those future systems that we are worried about as such ai safety has suddenly developed an empirical subfield while before we could only make predictions about what might go wrong and how we might fix those things now we can actually run experiments experiments are not and should never be the entirety of the field but it s a new and promising direction that leverages a different skill set to more classic ai safety in particular the different skill set it leverages is engineering running experiments on a real if weak ai system requires a substantial stack of custom software with projects running from hundreds of thousands to millions of lines of code dealing with these projects is not a skillset that many folks in ai safety had invested in prior to the last 18 months and it shows in our recruitment what kind of engineers looking at the engineers at anthropic right now every one of them was a great software engineer prior to joining ai safety every one of them is also easy to get on with beyond that common traits are experience with distributed systems experience with numerical systems caring about and thinking a lot about about ai safety comfortable reading contemporary ml research papers expertise in security infrastructure data numerics social science or one of a dozen other hard to find specialities this is not a requirements list though based on the people working here already great software engineer and easy to get on with are hard requirements but the things in the list above are very much nice to haves with several folks having just one or none of them right now our job listings are bucketed into security engineer infrastructure engineer research engineer and the like because these are the noun phrases that a lot of the people we like identify themselves with but what we re actually most concerned about are generally great software engineers who ideally have some extra bit of deep experience that we lack how does engineering compare to research at anthropic there is no hard distinction between researchers and engineers some other organisations retain the distinction but the increasing reliance of research on substantial custom infrastructure is dissolving the boundary at every industrial lab i m familiar with this might be hard to believe i think the archetypal research and engineering organisation is one where the researchers come up with the fun prototypes and then toss them over the wall to the engineers to clean up and implement i think the archetype is common enough that it dissuades a lot of engineers from applying to engineering roles instead applying to research positions where they when evaluated on a different set of metrics than the ones they re best at underperform what s changed in modern ai safety is that the prototypes now require serious engineering and so prototyping and experimenting is now an engineering problem from the get go a thousand line nested for loop does not carry research as far as it once did i think this might be a hard sell to folks who have endured those older kinds of research organisations so here are some anecdotes the first two authors on gpt 3 are both engineers some of the most pure engineers at anthropic spend weeks staring at learning curves and experimenting with architectural variants one of the most pure researchers at anthropic has spent a week rewriting an rpc protocol the most excited i ve ever seen anthropic folk for a new hire was for an engineer who builds academic clusters as a hobby should i apply it s hard to judge sight unseen whether a specific person would suit ai safety engineering but a good litmus test is the one given at the top of this post with a few weeks work could you hypothetically write a new feature or fix a serious bug in a major ml library are you already there could you get there with a month or two of effort i like this as a litmus test because it s very close to what my colleagues and i do all day if you re a strong enough engineer to make a successful pull request to pytorch you re likely a strong enough engineer to make a successful pull request to our internal repos actually the litmus test above is only one half of the actual litmus test i give folk that i meet out and about the other half is tell me your thoughts on ai and the future with a pass being a nuanced well thought out response should i skill up this post is aimed at folks who already can pass the litmus test i originally intended to pair it with another post on skilling up to the point of being able to pass the test but that has turned out to be a much more difficult topic than i expected for now i d recommend starting with 80k s software engineering guide take homes we want more great engineers if you could write a pull request for a major ml library you should apply to anthropic if that s not you but you know one or more great engineers ask them if they could write a pull request for a major ml library if yes tell them to apply to anthropic if that s not you but you d like it to be watch this space we re working on skilling up advice this is a twinned version of this post on lesswrong

r2kiya,0,cross validation leave one out and early stopping doubt hi i m using 10 f cross validation to evaluate the performance of my model on the whole dataset due to its size limit same thing with leave one group out which use as validation fold only images coming from the same source to evaluate if having images from the same source in the train or the test introduces a bias with this in mind i m using tensorflow and the early stopping with restore best weights set to true looking at the results i m getting a huge improvement on average performances using loo and reasoning on it i can understand why early stopping focuses on reducing overfitting in each fold being the folds in loo composed mainly by one to four images early stopping restore weights when my model is able to correctly classify that images when only one image is in the validation fold it stops whenever it s able to correctly classify that image my question is can i use cross validation leave one out along with early stopping does it falsificates the results i can t find any argument about this in the literature or anywere

ramg5l,1,gradient checking implementation not working most likely because of algorithm i am trying to implement gradient checking in java currently used with linear regression but it doesn t seem to work i want to check if my algorithm logistically makes sense because after checking via debugging all other methods seem to work but the actual result is wrong i ran a test case to find actual vs predicted values when running gradient check using x values of 1 2 3 and y values of 2 3 4 i got 2 84 calculated this by hand as well which means the algorithm i am using is wrong as the approximate gradient for the first weight theta0 which would be b in ax b the result i got from linear regression was 9 which is significantly different however i am more inclined to believe the linear regression is corrected as linear regression performs fine on the data but using the approximated values that gradient checking comes up with gives an inaccurate result while debugging my code i found no errors in the methods used so i am inclined to believe that it is an error with my algorithm the algorithm i am using is essentially the following i take my weights theta and iterate through them i add a value epsilon to the ith weight while keeping the rest of them the same next i calculate the cost with this new slightly changed weight vector and do the same thing except subtracting epsilon i then take the the two values and subtract them and divide by 2 epsilon these are my gradient approximations i add this to an array and repeat the process for all weights in the weight vector afterwards i calculate the euclidian distance between my gradient approximations and the gradients via gradient descent and divide that by the sum of the euclidian lengths of the approximation gradients and the true gradients this is the value i return i am posting a link to a gist which has my linear regression class that has the gradient check method this is the part that isn t working a few more notes dapprox is what i am calling my approximated gradient values and dtheta is the real gradient values traininputs is a matrix of the training data with a column of 1s attached before it trainoutputs is simply the outputs as a m 1 matrix where m is the number of data points in this case it is simply 2 3 4

qt4y6g,0,paper overview mae masked autoencoders are scalable vision learners video paper abstract this paper shows that masked autoencoders mae are scalable self supervised learners for computer vision our mae approach is simple we mask random patches of the input image and reconstruct the missing pixels it is based on two core designs first we develop an asymmetric encoder decoder architecture with an encoder that operates only on the visible subset of patches without mask tokens along with a lightweight decoder that reconstructs the original image from the latent representation and mask tokens second we find that masking a high proportion of the input image e g 75 yields a nontrivial and meaningful self supervisory task coupling these two designs enables us to train large models efficiently and effectively we accelerate training by 3x or more and improve accuracy our scalable approach allows for learning high capacity models that generalize well e g a vanilla vit huge model achieves the best accuracy 87 8 among methods that use only imagenet 1k data transfer performance in downstream tasks outperforms supervised pre training and shows promising scaling behavior

r2075f,0,not sure how to formulate this correctly has there been work done on learning what perception constitutes a reward and than using only that perception for learning let s say you have an agent in a maze searching for apples everytime it s viewpoint passes through an apple it gets a reward has there been an attempt to make the agent first learn the association between passing through apple and reward signal and then using only that perception for further training i feel one of the big problems we have is that we still can t give very detailed feedback to our agents and the reason for that is that the reward signal is subsymbolic so to speak so the agent cannot communicate or reason over it if an agent can learn to recognise a reward in it s perception we could communciate more effectively i m sure someone must have thought of something like this already but i don t know the term to google for

r7lc1e,0,unsupervised outlier detection advise requested hi all i am working on a strategy to detect outliers mostly multivariate data using unsupervised methods currently i am using dbscan optics in one group kmeans finding points that are 3 std from the mean of each group should be similar to centroid 3 standard deviations for a second group and lastly isolation forest and copod for a third group some of the output from each group could overlap with other groups but not all since each method finds different outliers in part of the spectrum each model is executed with point in time data in order to find outliers for that moment with respect to the values present at that time and not trained in a first step and then the model applied to the incoming data since i don t have regular outlier values and want to consider that point in time with incoming values regardless of what might have happened in the past since values might be affected in time by a number of factors is this a sensible approach would you suggest something different would you add any method either in parallel to the ones i mentioned or at the end like voting or anything else thanks in advance

qjx4k3,0,iccv2021 oral neural tmdlayer modeling instantaneous flow of features via sde generators with video explanation our tmdlayer is inspired by stochastic differential equation sde and aims to model the stochastic flow of features in principle it can be easily added on top of any dnn layer to bring the benefits in addition it immediately enables transductive inference once inserted into the model welcome to check out our video for a quick and easy understanding video paper code x200b our paper abstract we study how stochastic differential equation sde based ideas can inspire new modifications to existing algorithms for a set of problems in computer vision loosely speaking our formulation is related to both explicit and implicit strategies for data augmentation and group equivariance but is derived from new results in the sde literature on estimating infinitesimal generators of a class of stochastic processes if and when there is nominal agreement between the needs of an application task and the inherent properties and behavior of the types of processes that we can efficiently handle we obtain a very simple and efficient plug in layer that can be incorporated within any existing network architecture with minimal modification and only a few additional parameters we show promising experiments on a number of vision tasks including few shot learning point cloud transformers and deep variational segmentation obtaining efficiency or performance improvements

r09639,0,deepsquare news deepnews is our weekly update where we bring the latest news from the deepsquare project and our quest to develop sustainable high performance computing as a service ecosystem last week we talked about artificial intelligence and high performance computing with dr florin dzeladini today we will delve into deepsquare’s heart and soul sustainability by the hand of one of our board members frédéric juillard if you have been following the project for a while you will have realized our strong focus in sustainable hpc and energy reuse and that is because we truly mean it in deepsquare we are determined to take the next step towards sustainable hpc as a service and offer the best environmentally friendly alternative to the current status quo through the creation of a decentralized infrastructure backed by a professional team and cutting edge technology we have managed to create a growing community whose values align with our vision project update we are happy to be able to share the news that deepsquare supported our friends in alan analytics in delivering a project they worked on together with artist agnieszka kuran t the project resulted in ai generated “new” cave art based on a collection of data documented by paleoanthropologist genevieve von petzinger we used our test environment and csquare application to enable ai generated cave paintings it was really interesting to combine hpc ai and art and merge it into this fantastic project meet the team frédéric juillard is one of deepsquare’s board directors and a serial entrepreneur with an engineering background and sustainable deep tech having previously been involved in the foundation of other high tech companies he naturally fits within the character of the deepsquare association and his day to day work includes supporting the business and administration team and leading partnerships frédéric is above all a team player and believes sustainability to be “a key factor” of the project and the bedrock around which to gather a strong community “my favorite aspect is to be a part of this shared dream that we all have in the project and that more people believe in every day to see our community grow and on board with the same vision is something that i truly appreciate this social aspect interacting with people from very different backgrounds cultures and nationalities is something that perfectly aligns with the core values of deepsquare and the world of today” the community is indeed a key point for the future of sustainable hpc as a service every day more people are aware of the challenges coming ahead for the hpc industry which is already consuming a vast amount of the energy produced on the planet and will continue to grow in the next decade frédéric understands that only a shared effort rooted in a “trustful philosophy and backed by an extremely well prepared team” can face these future demands “the compute power that our world needs today is something absolutely crazy and these gross numbers are only going to keep growing society will shortly need to meet the demand for new technologies such as 5g autonomous cars smart cities and ever increasing connectivity sustainability is something that every innovative business should integrate there are clearly a lot of things to improve in hpc in terms of sustainability and i am certain deepsquare is part of the solution” to overcome these challenges the project has the latest hardware in the industry and a conscious plan to regularly update it to match the industry’s demands always with sustainability in mind frédéric believes it is “extremely important to find the right channel so this hardware can have a second life” and thus mitigate the damaging consequences of thoughtless it hardware disposal deepsquare clusters are thus designed with a green mindset but also tackle the growing needs of compute power coming down the line “standard hardware is already extremely efficient when converting a watt of electricity into a watt of heat and by using an immersion cooling system along with a system to reintroduce that heat into the building we have the best way to make a good and ecological use of otherwise wasted energy that’s clearly the most important aspect where the project can tackle the environmental problem and why in deepsquare we deliver sustainable high performance computing as a service” with the support of our community we are every day closer to democratizing high performance computing with better execution cost and social responsibility to learn more about deepsquare check out our website or if you want to connect with the team and the community follow us on twitter linkedin or join our telegram group
r8w4s7,1,feeling weirdly motivated and demotivated at the same time i am taking a class with all beginners in ml we got a dataset and out of 200 students i am one of the lowest even though i tried pretty hard i have ran a full searchgridcv for a random forest tree and can t get it above 68 even though more than 60 of the students have an accuracy over 70 i have also tried the same for xgboosting same story stuck at 67 due to covid the course started offline and i don t really know anyone so i can t ask them it s the middle of the weekend and it s killing me the dataset is pretty clean already but i removed the features of low importance that gave a small boost but didn t help much somehow it demotivates me but at the same time i feel obsessed trying to get to that 70 and learn more about the algorithms has anybody ever been in the same spot and has some tips for when you feel like this
r75uix,0,the new library to make clip guided image generation simpler there are different ways to generate images by their text descriptions but one of the most powerful approaches to generate synthetic art is clip guided image generation we provide a new python library that incapsulates the whole logic of the clip guided loss into one pytorch primitive with a simple api we provide clip guided loss using different clip models such as original clip models by openai and ruclip model by sberai multiple prompts texts or images as targets for optimization and automatic detection and translation of the input texts also we provide our tiny implementation of the vqgan clip based on our library and vqvae by sberai in my opinion this is the best version of the vqgan that is publicly available to make text to image our library is all you need to integrate text powered losses into your image synthesis pipelines by adding a few lines of code you can find our library here pypi package is available
rcdhkt,0,learning multiple gaits of quadruped robot using hierarchical reinforcement learning hello we share our results of learning multiple gaits of quadruped robot using hierarchical reinforcement learning we simply parameterized the policy output considering the periodic features of different gaits although currently there are some limitations we hope the proposed simple method could give insights to other researchers in related fields if you are curious of the methods and results in detail check the paper slides and code linked below enjoy title learning multiple gaits of quadruped robot using hierarchical reinforcement learning abstract there is a growing interest in learning a velocity command tracking controller of quadruped robot using reinforcement learning due to its robustness and scalability however a single policy trained end to end usually shows a single gait regardless of the command velocity this could be a suboptimal solution considering the existence of optimal gait according to the velocity for quadruped animals in this work we propose a hierarchical controller for quadruped robot that could generate multiple gaits i e pace trot bound while tracking velocity command our controller is composed of two policies each working as a central pattern generator and local feedback controller and trained with hierarchical reinforcement learning experiment results show 1 the existence of optimal gait for specific velocity range 2 the efficiency of our hierarchical controller compared to a controller composed of a single policy which usually shows a single gait codes are publicly available paper slides code contact awesomericky snu ac kr mailto awesomericky snu ac kr
r4wd3a,1,how to illustrate in a fairly simple manner how roberta gets fine tuned on a downstream task my thesis defense is coming up next week and i wanted to have your take on an issue i m currently facing one of my thesis contributions is adapting roberta to the task of rumor detection on twitter i want to explain to the jury how roberta can adjust its weights based on the dataset that i fine tune it on in simple terms i fed roberta a variety of datasets describing the task of rumor detection on twitter while altering the class distribution in the datasets to see how it influences the embedding that roberta produces i evaluated the quality of the embeddings by feeding them to a set of classifiers random forest decision tree svm to see how they perform i used standard metrics precision recall and f1 score focusing on the model performance in recognizing the class rumor i was considering explaining it this way roberta takes in a tweet with a label rumor non rumor then it weighs the words and their impact on the class in question and words that occur often in a class are the ones that are potentially correlated to it but i feel like that s too much watering down and even an insult to the intricacy involved in roberta s inner workings so for you out there with much more knowledge and expertise than me will you please indulge my request and enlighten me on how one can explain the details of fine tuning pre trained language models on a downstream task
rc4yiw,0,imputation methods for missing data maybe it is simple question but i want to see your opinions on this i have small dataset of about 2000 3000 samples that were third party collected since physicians were collecting most of that data they most of time think like “ oh i forgot to ask this question to patient or to do this analysis who cares” problem is that 5 10 of data is missing but in different categories which makes it impossible to remove so i wanted to check your opinion about imputation methods

rjqgrc,0,one to many mapping using probabilistic unet hi i have been working on this project for over a month now however i couldn’t make it work yet so i need help it is basically applying the probabilistic unet paper on the leaf segmentation dataset given an image i want to output one instance at a time by sampling from a distribution the probabilistic unet architecture is shown below x200b x200b the architecture has two loss components the kl divergence and reconstruction loss when i train it the kl loss goes to zero however the reconstruction loss works differently that what i want what i want 1 sample a noise 2 get one instance x200b x200b what actually happens is that the noise is ignored it acts like a semantic segmentation basically the rgb image and the different instances are mapped to the same latent space i have tried beta scheduling kl and even removed the kl term but the noise is still ignored x200b x200b x200b can someone be kind enough to review my code here or explain why this approach might not work thank you
rbj8vg,1,interpreting clustering results hi all beginner here i did kmeans clustering for customer data and added the cluster labels back to the original data which will then be exported as a csv cluster labels in an additional column wondering how do we do the analysis now for the customer personna ideally we want to be able to say eg cluster 1 are the well to do men in their 40s cluster 2 are the women in technology in their 20s etc do we do pivot tables and averages in the excel or do we intepret from the centroid table in jupyter notebook below here is an example of the centroid table output from jupyter notebook different from actual but how would one interpret this would i say for example cluster 1 is the group of people with lowest cooling tower frequency and relatively low humidity etc cluster 4 contains people with the highest cooling tower frequency and highest relative humidity thanks so much in advance
rkv8zg,1,advice on multiple linear regression with sklearn so i am new to machine learning and i want your thoughts if i m doing this right it s probably not the best for prediction but i m doing this to combine a love of sports and to practice on things that i m learning through school the dataset i m using is 5 years worth of english premier league data in short i ve created a program to get the standings of a given year through x many games that i want it includes w l d points gf and ga in the end dataset i have 5 years worth of data for the teams up to the xth game of the season using sklearn i built a multiple linear regression model that uses the gf and ga to predict points for whatever x amount of games played that i wanted the end dataset that i just previously mentioned was what i used to do the training and testing with so now with that model being trained and tested i use the current season s standings through the x amount of games to predict how many points the team should have i think it s doing the job well as most of the points predicted are pretty close to the actual points now my big question say this season gets finished should i add this season to my training and testing dataset and rerun the model so that i maintain accuracy for next season s predictions

r73sq8,1,multi task learning how s that done hi guys i ve recently heard about the concept of multi task learning i ll call it mtl i ve read some articles online and have watched some youtube videos on the topic however there are some aspects that i don t understand assume that we have a project that we want to do mtl on 3 seperate tasks what i know is there is a base model to extract features and then there are three models on top of that to do the tasks what i don t understand is how do we train these models is it done simultanously if yes there will be three set of gradients backpropagated for each task to update the base model then ho do we handle that if no then how do we train the base model
rdtaiy,0,discussion quick reminder servers go up to 24tb of ram i ve seen this sub lamenting a bunch of times about large companies having models only large companies can run and use the latest such is a bunch of comments in the deepmind thread maybe i am missing something but i think there is a chance that people here have an outdated view of computers so i want to just state a few facts and understand if given these limitations there would still be any problem for a normal research lab to run large models currently outside of super computers and the latest 2021 hardware the most ram a motherboard can fit is 24 5tb running with 8x intel xeons and available on e g aws good intel xeons are very fast i e probably faster than an old gen cuda 11 compatible gpu even for gpu optimized libraries ala torch much faster than all but a few gpus with cpu optimized optimization algorithms hash map based are used server motherboards can also fit up to 8gpus i think this number should actually be 32 but i ve never seen an offer with more than 8 so eh most cloud providers have 16gb gpus with up to 8gpus per server the largest gpus run 80gb of ram though they are not widely available the largest gpu optimized servers boast 1 3t of gpu ram x200b price wise buying said gpu servers are hard to pin down but seem to be in the 200 600k range i assume they are or will soon be available to rent and that price will translate to 200 600 hr for expensive providers and maybe as low as 50 100 for cheap ones with older models but this is an uneducated estimate based on cpu server pricing compared to buy price prices for the 6 2tb server are 50 hr and presumably the 24 5tb version is 200 hr it seems to me like both the cpu and gpu routes here should allow for training and certainly running very big model more so than the biggest models from either google or openai the price point is high but operating at 200 hr or putting down half a million for hardware every 1 3 years seems more than reasonable for a small time well funded lab given that most researcher salaries are 1 4th to 1x that amount given that often enough you can do research work on models that are smaller and extract valid heuristics for models 10 100x the size this is not necessary obviously this is prohibitive for most people i can t run it on my laptop but it seems unfair to say that large text or image models are limited to a few giant corporations with their server farms it seems that a bloke with no knowledge of clustering computers and half a million worth of funding could easily work with models the size of gpt 3 not only for inference but also for testing this seems to increase the availability of such models to something like a few dozen thousand companies and a few hundred or even thousands of well funded academic labs
